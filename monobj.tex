\section{Monoidal objects in locally cubical bicategories}
\label{sec:mono-objects}

We now move on to define an appropriate abstract sort of ``monoidal object'' that will be preserved by the product-preserving functor $\cH$, and that specializes to monoidal double categories and to monoidal bicategories.
It would be nice if we could stay entirely in the world of iconic tricategories (that is, \Icon-enriched bicategories); but unfortunately the usual composition of monoidal functors between monoidal bicategories is not strictly associative, so they do not form an iconic tricategory.

However, they do form a more general structure, namely a bicategory enriched over \cDbl; in~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} this is called a \textbf{locally cubical bicategory}.
Since any bicategory can be regarded as a double category with only identity 1-morphisms, any iconic tricategory can be regarded as a locally cubical bicategory, but the latter are more general.
In particular, in a locally cubical bicategory the composition of 1-morphisms is associative only up to an invertible (vertical) 2-morphism.
And indeed, one of the results of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} is that monoidal bicategories form a locally cubical bicategory; here we will generalize this to monoidal objects, perhaps braided and symmetric, in any iconic tricategory with finite products --- and indeed, in any locally cubical bicategory with finite products.

Since \cDbl\ is also a cartesian monoidal 2-category, we can define what it means for a locally cubical bicategory to have finite products, and this property is preserved when regarding an iconic tricategory as a locally cubical bicategory.
In particular, this applies to \cDblf\ and to \cBicat\ --- but actually, in place of the iconic tricategory \cBicat\ considered up until now we will focus instead on the locally cubical bicategory of bicategories constructed in~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}, whose ``locally horizontal part'' is \cBicat, but whose vertical 2-cells are \emph{icons}.
We denote this by \fBicat; it is easy to see that it also has products preserved by the inclusion $\cBicat\to \fBicat$, so that the composite functor $\cH : \cDblf \to\fBicat$ still preserves products.

We now define symmetric, braided and monoidal structures on objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells internal to a locally cubical bicategory with products, by taking the definitions of monoidal, braided, and symmetric structure for bicategories given in~\cite{nick:tricatsbook},~\cite{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}, and~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} and regarding the data of bicategories, functors, pseudonatural transformations, and modifications abstractly as objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells in a locally cubical bicategory.

Note that under this translation pseudonatural transformations become \emph{horizontal} 2-cells and modifications become globular 3-cells.
The horizontal 2-cells in \cDblf\ (which has no nonidentity vertical 2-morphisms) are the (vertical) transformations, while those in \fBicat\ are exactly the pseudonatural transformations (its vertical 2-morphisms are icons).

Before we give the definitions of monoidal cells, we recall the structure of a locally cubical bicategory. Locally cubical bicategories have three types of composition. Firstly, we have horizontal composition "$\horc$" within the hom- double categories. This gives us composition of horizontal 2-cells along a 1-cell boundary and of 3-cells along a vertical 2-cell bounday. We write this composition in the order of diagrammatic composition: $\alpha \horc \beta$, meaning "$\beta$ after $\alpha$". Horizontal composition is weakly associative and horizontal identities hold up to isomorphism. We write $U_{f}$ and $U_{\alpha}$ for the horizontal identity on a 1-cell $f$ and a vertical 2-cell $\alpha$, respectively. 
Secondly, we have vertical composition "$\verc$" in the hom-double categories. This gives us composition of vertical 2-cells along a 1-cell boundary and vertical composition of 3-cells along a horizontal 2-cell boundary, written in the conventional order: $f \verc g$ denoting "$f$ after $g$". Vertical composition is strictly associative and has strict identities.
Thirdly, there is composition "$\comp$" of 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells along a 0-cell boundary, given by the bicategorical structure. We write this composition in the conventional order: $f \comp g$ meaning "$f$ after $g$". When it is clear from the context, we omit the composition symbol "$\comp$",  and write the juxtaposition of 1-cells instead. This composition is weak with weak identities. We write $\compI$ for the unit double functor. Note that by functoriality, the image of $\compI_A$ is given by some 1-cell $\compI_A$, the identity vertical 2-cell $id_{\compI_A}$, some horizontal 2-cell $\compI_{\compI_A}$ which is naturally isomorphic to the identity for horizontal composition $U_{\compI_A}$ and the identity 3-cell  $\id_{\compI_{\compI_A}}$.
As two of the compositions, "$\horc$", and "$\comp$" are weak, we sometimes use special notation to distinguish between their associators and unitos, given by the composition symbol in superscript: $\hora, \horr$, $\horl$, and $\compa, \compr$, $\compl$, respectively.

Let \fB\ be a locally cubical bicategory with products.

\begin{defn}
A {\bf monoidal object} in \fB\ is an object $A$, equipped with 1-cells $\otimes: A \times A \rightarrow A$ and $I_A: * \rightarrow A$, and horizontal 2-cells
\begin{itemize} 
\item $\alpha: \ten  (\id \times \tens) \xslashedRightarrow{} \ten (\tens \times \id)$
\item $l: \ten (I \times \id) \xslashedRightarrow{} \id$ and $r:\ten (\id \times I) \xslashedRightarrow{} \id$ 
\end{itemize}
Finally, it must be equipped with the invertible globular 3-cells $\pi, \mu, \lambda, \rho$, relating the two different ways around the Mac Lane pentagon and the three other coherence diagrams given in Definition 4.1 of~\cite{nick:tricatsbook}, which satisfy the appropriate three axioms.

A monoidal object is {\bf braided} if in addition there is a horizontal 2-cell $\sigma_A: \tens \xslashedRightarrow{} \ten \tau$, where $\tau: A \times A \rightarrow A \times A$ interchanges the two copies of $A$; and if there are invertible globular 3-cells 

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
satisfying the axioms (BA1), (BA2), (BA3), and (BA4) given in~\cite[p136--139]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} . 
It is {\bf sylleptic} when there exists an invertible globular 3-cell

 \[
 \begin{tikzpicture}
 \node (tl) at (-2,1) {$\ten$};
 \node (tr) at (2,1) {$\ten$};
 \node (b) at (0,-.25) {$\tens \tau$};
 \draw[double] (tl)  -- (tr);

 \]
  satisfying the axioms (SA1), (SA2) on~\cite[p144--145]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. It is {\bf symmetric} if in addition, it satisfies the axiom given on~\cite[p91]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}.
\end{defn}

By construction, these definitions give the expected results in \fBicat.
In \cDblf, where there are no nonidentity 3-cells, they reduce to the definitions from section~\ref{sec:symm-mono-double}; and in particular every syllepsis is a symmetry.

\begin{defn}
Let $A,B$ be monoidal objects in \fB. A 1-cell $f:A \rightarrow B$ is {\bf lax monoidal} when it is equipped with the following horizontal 2-cells:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\chi: \ten (f \times f) \xslashedRightarrow{} f  \otimes$
\item $\iota: I_B \xslashedRightarrow{} f I_A$
\end{itemize}
As well as globular invertible 3-cells $\omega: \alpha_A \horc \chi \horc (\chi \times \id) \RRightarrow \chi \horc (\id \times \chi) \horc \alpha_B$ , $\gamma: (\id \times l) \horc \chi \horc (\iota \times \id) \RRightarrow l$, and $\delta: (
id \odot l) \horc \chi \horc (\id \times \iota) \RRightarrow r$ given in Definition 4.10 of~\cite{nick:tricatsbook}, expressing the usual associativity and unitality conditions, which satisfy the two given commutativity axioms.
A monoidal 1-cell is called {\bf braided}, when $A$ and $B$ are braided and there is a horizontal 2-cell $u: \sigma_B \horc \chi  \xslashedRightarrow \chi \horc (f \sigma_A)$, satisfying the braiding axioms analogous to (BHA1) and (BHA2) given in  \cite[p141-142]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. It is {\bf symmetric} when $A$ and $B$ are symmetric and the 3-cells defining the braided monoidal structure of $f$ satisfy the additional axiom analogous to  (SHA1) given in   \cite[p145]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}.

When the natural transformations are in the opposite direction, the functor is {\bf oplax monoidal}, and when they are isomorphisms, the functor is {\bf strong monoidal}.
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}\label{Def:monverttrans}
Let $f, g:A \rightarrow B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB. A {\bf lax monoidal 2-cell} $\alpha: f \xslashedRightarrow{} g$ is a horizontal 2-cell in \fB\ that is equipped with globular 3-cells
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Pi: \chi_f \horc (\alpha \comp U_{\ten}) \xslashedRightarrow{} U_{\ten}(\alpha \times \alpha) \horc \chi_g$
\item $M: \iota_f \horc (\alpha \comp U_{\ten}) \xslashedRightarrow{} \iota_g$
\end{itemize}

Such that coherence equations analogous to (IA1)-(IA3) of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} hold.
An {\bf oplax monoidal 2-cell} between oplax monoidal 1-cells, is a 2-cell with the same data, but with the arrows in the opposite direction. If $g,f$ are strong monoidal and $\Pi, M$ are isomorphisms, we call $\alpha$ a {\bf strong monoidal 2-cell}.
such that the three coherence axioms in definition 3 of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} hold.
A monoidal 2-cell is {\bf braided} or {\bf symmetric} when $f,g$ are braided or symmetric, and in addition the coherence axiom analogous to (BTA1) of~\cite[p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} holds. Note that here the author writes $\rho$ for our braiding 1-cell $\sigma$.
\end{defn}

As remarked above, we will actually construct a locally cubical bicategory of monoidal objects.
The monoidal 2-cells will be the horizontal 2-cells therein; we now define the vertical 2-morphisms.

\begin{defn}\label{Def:monicon}
  Let $f, g:A \rightarrow B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB.
  A \textbf{lax monoidal icon} $\alpha: f \Rightarrow g$ is a (vertical) 2-morphism in \fB\ that is equipped with 3-cells

such that the coherence axioms (TA2), (TA3), and (TA4) analogous to definition 2 of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} hold.
An {\bf oplax monoidal icon} between oplax monoidal 1-cells, is a 2-cell with the same data. If $g,f$ are strong monoidal and $\Pi, M$ are isomorphisms, we call $\alpha$ a {\bf strong monoidal icon}.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:dc}
  Let $A,B$ be monoidal objects. The lax monoidal 1-cells, monoidal 2-cells, monoidal icons, and monoidal 3-cells in $\fB (A,B)$ form a double category $\cM on\cB (A,B)$. The same statement holds for colax and strong monoidal objects and cells and if $A,B$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, for braided, sylleptic, and symmetric cells, respectively.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The first step of this proof is to show that lax monoidal 1-cells and icons form a category. 
For each monoidal 1-cell $f:A \rightarrow B$, the identity on $f$ is given by the identity 2-cell $\id_f$, together with the following 3-cells $M^{\id_f} := \id_{\iota_f}$ and $\Pi^{\id_f} := \id_{\chi_f}$. This is well-defined, because the functor "$\comp$" preserves identities. The conditions for monoidal 3-cells are trivially satisfied.  For each two monoidal 1-cells $f,g$ and monoidal icons $\alpha, \beta: f \Rightarrow g$, the composite vertical 2-cell $\beta \circ \alpha$ can be equiped with the monoidal structure given by the composites $M^{\beta \circ \alpha} := M^{\beta} \circ M^{\alpha}$ and $\Pi^{\beta\circ \alpha} : = \Pi^{\beta} \circ \Pi^{\alpha}$.  We have a strict interchange law between $\verc$ and $\comp$, so these 3-cells are well-defined. The coherence conditions (TA1)-(TA4) hold by componentwise application of the coherence equalities for $M^{\beta \verc \alpha}$ and $\Pi^{\beta \verc \alpha}$. The same argument holds for oplax and strong monoidal 1-cells and icons.

In addition, we need that lax monoidal 2-cells and monoidal 3-cells form a category. For every lax monoidal 2-cell $\alpha: f \xslashedRightarrow{} g$, the identity 3-cell $\id_{\alpha}$ in $\cB$  is monoidal, since the required two equations are again trivially satisfied.
For any two monoidal 3-cells $N: \alpha \Rightthreecell \beta$, $K:\beta \Rightthreecell \gamma$, the composition $K \circ N$ in $\cB$ is a monoidal 3-cell. The equations for monoidal 3-cells hold by sequential application of the respective equations for $N$ and $K$. The same is true for oplax and strong monoidal 2-cells.

Now we describe the horizontal structure.
Let $\alpha:f \xslashedRightarrow{} g$ and $\beta: g \xslashedRightarrow{} h$ be two monoidal 2-cells. Their composition $\alpha \horc \beta$ is monoidal with the following structure 3-cells.

\begin{equation}

The first condition of monoidal 3-cells is trivial for $M^{\alpha \horc \beta}$ and the second is obtained by applying the second condition for $M^{\alpha}$, after applying the second condition for $M^{\beta}$. The conditions for monoidal 3-cells are obtained by applying the interchange law between $\horc$ and $\comp$, followed by sequential application of the corresponding condition for $\Pi^{\beta}$ and $\Pi^{\alpha}$. 
The coherence equations are satisfied by sequential application of the respective equation for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be 3 monoidal 3-cells. Their composite $\Gamma \horc \Delta$ is again monoidal. The conditions for monoidal 3-cells follow directly from the conditions on the monoidal 3-cells $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$. 


For each lax monoidal 1-cell $f$ the horizontal identity 2-cell $U_f$ is a monoidal 2-cell with monoidal structure given below. The first condition for the monoidal structure of these 3-cells holds as the right-hand-side corresponds to $M^{\iota_f \horc U_f}$, and $M^{\iota_f \horc U_f}$, respectively, and the left-hand-side is the composition of $M^{\iota}$ and $M^{U_f}$, $\Pi^{\iota}$ and $\Pi^{U_f}$  that define these cells.  The second condition for $M^{U_f}$ and  $\Pi^{U_f}$ assert that $\Pi^{\iota_f}$ and $\Pi^{\chi_f}$ pasted together with coherence 3-cells $\horl$ and $\horr$ is equal to itself. (????)
The coherence diagrams hold naturally, as they all assert some 3-cell pasted together with coherence cells to be equal to itself.

For every monoidal icon $\gamma$, the horizontal identity 3-cell $U_f$ is a monoidal 3-cell. The conditions for monoidal 3-cells follow from the naturality conditions or $\horl$ and $\horr$. 

Functoriality of the horizontal composition functor $\horc$ holds, as it holds in $\cB$.
To finish the first part of this proof, we need to verify that the unitality and associativity constraints $\hora$, $\horl$, and $\horr$ are monoidal 3-cells.
For $r$ this is exactly the same argument as we gave for $M^{U_f}$, for $\horl$ the proof is similar, but also makes use of the triangle equation. For $\hora$, there are more steps, but essentially it follows from coherence of the functor $\horc$.

\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:lcbc}
  Monoidal objects, lax monoidal 1-cells, monoidal 2-cells, monoidal icons, and monoidal 3-cells in \fB\ form a locally cubical bicategory $\cM on\cB$. The same statement holds for colax and strong monoidal objects and cells and for braided, sylleptic, and symmetric objects and cells.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We have established that homsets $\cM oncB(A,B)$ of monoidal cells between two monoidal objects form double categories in Proposition \ref{prop:dc}. It is left to show that monoidal objects and cells have the enriched structure of a locally double bicategory.

We need to check that the unit $I^{\comp}_A$ is a well-defined functor from the trivial double category $1$ to the hom-category $\cM on\cB(A,A)$. 
All the cells in its image are the identities, which are monoidal, so the only thing to verify is that $I^{\comp}_{U}$ and $I^{\comp}_{\odot}$ are monoidal 3-cells. 

[Fill in the details]

Next, we need to show that monoidal structure is presrved by the composition along a 0-cell boundary.
For any two lax monoidal 1-cells $f:A \rightarrow B$, $g:B \rightarrow C$, the composite $g \comp f$ is monoidal with 
\begin{align}
\chi_{g \comp f} &:= &\ten (g\comp f \times g\comp f) \xrightarrow{\chi_g \comp U_{(f \times f)}} g \ten (f \times f) \xrightarrow{U_g \comp \chi_f} gf\ten\\
\iota_{g \comp f} & := &I_C \xrightarrow{\iota_g} g I_B \xrightarrow{U_g \comp \iota_f} gfI_A
\end{align}

For oplax monoidal 1-cells, the the above gives the monoidal structure if the arrows are reversed.

Let $f,h: A \rightarrow B $ and $g,i: B \rightarrow C$ be lax monoidal 1-cells and let $\alpha: f \rightarrow h$, $\beta: g \rightarrow i$ be lax monoidal 2-cells, the composite $\beta \comp \alpha$ is lax monoidal with the following structure 3-cells

Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be two composable monoidal 3-cells. IT is easy to see that the composition $\Gamma \comp \Delta$ satisfies the two equations for monoidal 3-cells. This is a matter of applying the equations for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ sequentially.
