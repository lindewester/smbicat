\section{Monoidal objects in locally cubical bicategories}
\label{sec:mono-objects}


%Moreover, we want $\cH$ to act on monoidal morphisms between such monoidal objects, and indeed to extend to a functor between categories of monoidal objects.
%It would be nice if this enhanced functor $\cH$ could stay entirely in the world of iconic tricategories (that is, \Icon-enriched bicategories); but unfortunately the usual composition of monoidal functors between monoidal bicategories is not strictly associative, so they do not form an iconic tricategory.

%However, they do form a more general structure, namely a bicategory enriched over \cDbl; in~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} this is called a \textbf{locally cubical bicategory}.
%Since any bicategory can be regarded as a double category with only identity tight 1-morphisms, any iconic tricategory can be regarded as a locally cubical bicategory, but the latter are more general.
%In addition to the objects, 1-morphisms, 2-cells (now called ``loose 2-cells''), and 3-cells (now called ``globular 3-cells'') of an iconic tricategory, a locally cubical bicategory contains \emph{tight} 2-morphisms, and square-shaped 3-cells.
%The composition of 1-morphisms in a locally cubical bicategory is associative only up to an invertible \emph{tight} 2-morphism. One of the results of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} is that monoidal bicategories form a locally cubical bicategory. 
%We will generalize this theorem to monoidal objects, perhaps braided, sylleptic and symmetric, in any iconic tricategory with finite products --- and indeed, in any locally cubical bicategory with finite products.

%Since \cDbl, like \Icon, is a cartesian monoidal 2-category, we can define what it means for a locally cubical bicategory to have finite products, and this property is preserved when regarding an iconic tricategory as a locally cubical bicategory.
%In particular, this applies to \cDblf\ and to \cBicat\ --- but actually, in place of the iconic tricategory \cBicat\ considered up until now we will focus instead on the locally cubical bicategory of bicategories constructed in~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}, whose ``locally loose part'' is \cBicat, but whose tight 2-cells are \emph{icons}.
%We denote this by \fBicat; it is easy to see that it also has products preserved by the inclusion $\cBicat\to \fBicat$, so that the composite functor $\cH : \cDblf \to\fBicat$ still preserves products.
We now move on to define an appropriate abstract sort of ``monoidal objects'', that will be preserved by the product-preserving functor $\cH$, and that specializes to monoidal double categories and to monoidal bicategories. 
Such structures are obtained by abstracting the definitions of monoidal, braided, and symmetric structure for bicategories given in~\cite{nick:tricatsbook},~\cite{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}, and~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}. 
Under this translation pseudonatural transformations become \emph{loose} 2-cells and modifications become globular 3-cells.
Recall that the loose 2-cells in \fDblf\ (which has no nonidentity tight 2-morphisms) are the (tight) transformations, while those in \fBicat\ are exactly the pseudonatural transformations (its tight 2-morphisms are icons).
We will define monoidal, braided, sylleptic and symmetric objects, 1-cell, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells by taking instances of bicategories, functors, pseudonatural transformations, and modifications in the original definitions as objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells, respectively. 

Before we give the definitions of monoidal cells, we unfold the structure of a locally cubical bicategory and fix our notation. In addition to objects, locally cubical bicategories have 4 different elements, which together form the hom-double categories. We call the objects, loose 1-cells and 2-morphisms of the hom-double category '1-cells', '2-cells' and '3-cells', respectively; the tight 1-morphisms are called 'icons', after the icons between pseudofunctors. The structure contains three types of composition. We will adopt the notation introduced for intercategories~\cite{gp:intercategories-i}, of which locally cubical bicategories are a special case. Firstly, we have loose composition ``$\horc$" within the hom- double categories. This gives us composition of loose 2-cells along a 1-cell boundary and of 3-cells along a tight 2-cell boundary. We write this composition in the order of diagrammatic composition: $\alpha \horc \beta$, meaning ``$\beta$ after $\alpha$". We write $\looseid_{f}$ and $\looseid_{\alpha}$ for the loose identity on a 1-cell $f$ and a tight 2-cell $\alpha$, respectively. Loose composition is weakly associative and loose identities hold up to isomorphism. 
Secondly, we have tight composition ``$\verc$" in the hom-double categories. This gives us composition of tight 2-cells along a 1-cell boundary and tight composition of 3-cells along a loose 2-cell boundary, written in the conventional order: $f \verc g$ denoting ``$f$ after $g$". We write $\tightid_f$ and $\tightid_{\alpha}$ for the tight identity on a 1-cell $f$ and a loose 2-cell $\alpha$, respectively; we denote the associator, left and right unitor for $\hor$ by $\hora, \horr, \horl$, respectively. Tight composition is strictly associative and has strict identities. 
Thirdly, there is composition ``$\comp$" of 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells along a 0-cell boundary, given by the enriched structure. We write this composition in the conventional order: $f \comp g$ meaning ``$f$ after $g$". When it is clear from the context, we omit the composition symbol ``$\comp$",  and write the juxtaposition of 1-cells instead. The identities for this composition are denoted by ``$\transid$". We denote the associator, left and right unitor for $\comp$ by $\compa, \compr, \compl$, respectively.
We write ``$\onecell$" to denote 1-cells, ``$\looseRightarrow$" to denote the loose 2-cells, ``$\Rightarrow$" to denote the tight 2-cells and ``$\RRightarrow$" to denote $3$-cells.

For readability, we will implicitly strictify the hom-double categories, as we did with the double categories in Section~\ref{sec:symm-mono-double}, except where we prove that this structure is preserved by monoidal cells. As a consequence, we omit the associativity and unit constraints for $\comp$ and $\verc$ in various places.
Furthermore, we restrict our input locally cubical bicategories by assuming that composition of 1-cells along 0-cells is strict, in the following precise sense:

\begin{defn}\label{defn:1strict}
  A locally cubical bicategory is \textbf{1-strict} if the tight transformations $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\rho$ from \cref{def:lcbc} are globular, i.e.\ their tight 1-cell components are identities.
  Similarly, a functor of locally cubical bicategories is \textbf{1-strict} if the tight transformations $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ from \cref{def:lcbcfunc} are globular.
\end{defn}

Our primary examples $\fDblf$ and $\fBicat$ are 1-strict, as is the functor $\cH:\fDblf\to\fBicat$.
This simplifying restriction enables an almost-literal transposition of definition from the world of bicategories, as long as the monoidal constraints and coherence axioms are reformulated in equational form instead of their original diagrammatic expression of 2-cell composites in the target bicategory.
\fxnote[author=MS]{Something about whiskering here?}
(We also expect that there is a coherence theorem replacing any locally cubical bicategory by an equivalent 1-strict one.)

Note that certain constraint 2-cells are suppressed in~\cite{nick:tricatsbook},~\cite{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}, and~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} to simplify notation, but in the equational form below, this cannot be done; thus the coherence equations look more intimidating, but in fact are not more complicated than their bicategorical counterparts. Consequently, locally cubical bicategories with this property have ``all the formal behavior'' of $\fBicat$.
We give the coherence axioms for monoidal objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells explicitly, but leave the axioms for braided, symmetric and sylleptic monoidal structures as an exercise for the reader.


Let \fB\ be a 1-strict locally cubical bicategory with products.

\begin{defn}
A {\bf monoidal object} in \fB\ is an object $A$, equipped with 1-cells $\otimes: A \times A \onecell A$ and $I_A: * \onecell A$, and 2-cells
\begin{itemize} 
\item $\alpha: \ten (\tens \times \id) \looseRightarrow{} \ten  (\id \times \tens) $
\item $l: \ten (I \times \transid) i_2 \looseRightarrow{} \transid$ and $r:\ten (\transid \times I) i_1 \looseRightarrow{} \transid$ 
\end{itemize}
where $*$ is the initial object of $\fB$ and $i_1: A \rightarrow A \times *$, $i_2: A \rightarrow 
* \times A$ are the embedding morphisms defining the products $A \times *$ and $* \times A$, respectively. Finally, it must be equipped with the invertible globular 3-cells $\pi, \mu, \lambda, \rho$ depicted below, which generalise the Mac Lane pentagon and the three other coherence diagrams given in Definition 4.1 of~\cite{nick:tricatsbook}. The horizontally drawn equality is added for readability. These 3-cells must satisfy the three axioms~These 3-cells must satisfy the three axioms~\eqref{eq:monobjeq1},~\eqref{eq:monobjeq2}~\eqref{eq:monobjeq3} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence}, which generalise the coherence axioms for monoidal bicategories~\cite[Definition 4.1]{nick:tricatsbook}.

A monoidal object is {\bf braided} if, in addition, it is equipped with a loose 2-cell $\sigma_A: \tens \looseRightarrow{} \mathord{\ten} \tau$, where $\tau: A \times A \rightarrow A \times A$ interchanges the two copies of $A$; and if there are invertible globular 3-cells 
\input{R}
\input{S}
satisfying axioms analogous to (BA1), (BA2), (BA3), and (BA4) given in~\cite[p136--139]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} . 
It is {\bf sylleptic} when it is additionally equipped with an invertible globular 3-cell
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \begin{tikzpicture}

 \end{equation}
  satisfying the axioms analogous to (SA1), (SA2) on~\cite[p144--145]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. It is {\bf symmetric} if in addition, it satisfies the axiom analogous to the equation given on~\cite[p91]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
Let $A,B$ be monoidal objects in \fB. A 1-cell $f:A \onecell B$ is {\bf lax monoidal} when it is equipped with the following loose 2-cells:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\chi: \mathord{\ten} (f \times f) \looseRightarrow{} f  \mathord{\otimes}$
\item $\iota: I_B \looseRightarrow{} fI_A $
\end{itemize}
as well as globular invertible 3-cells 
%remember that we write the horizontal composition \horc in diagrammatic order!
\begin{align*}
& \omega:  \looseid_{\tens}(\chi \times \looseid_f)  \horc  \chi\looseid_{\tens \times \transid} \horc  \looseid_f \alpha \RRightarrow \alpha\looseid_{f \times f \times f}  \horc \looseid_{\tens}(\looseid \times \chi)  \horc \chi \looseid_{\transid \times \tens}  \\
 &\gamma: \looseid_{\tens}(\iota_f \times \looseid_f) \looseid_{i_2} \horc \chi \looseid_{I \times \transid} \looseid_{i_2} \horc \looseid_f l\RRightarrow l \looseid_f \\
 &\delta:  \looseid_f r^{-1} \RRightarrow r^{-1} \looseid_f \horc \looseid_{\tens} (\looseid \times \iota) \looseid_{i_1 f} \horc \chi \looseid_{(\transid \times I)i_1}
\end{align*}
which satisfy the two axioms~\eqref{eq:laxfunc1},~\eqref{eq:laxfunc2} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence}, expressing the usual associativity and unitality conditions~\cite[Definition 4.10]{nick:tricatsbook}.

A lax monoidal 1-cell is called {\bf braided}, when $A$ and $B$ are braided and there is a globular 3-cell 
\begin{equation*}
u: \sigma_B \looseid_{f \times f} \horc \chi  \looseid_{\tau} \looseRightarrow \chi \horc (\looseid_f \sigma_A)
\end{equation*}
satisfying braiding axioms analogous to (BHA1) and (BHA2) given in~\cite[p141-142]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. 

The 1-cell $f:A \onecell B$ is {\bf colax monoidal} when it is equipped with loose 2-cells $\bar{\chi}$ and $\bar{\iota}$ which go in the opposite direction of $\chi$ and $\iota$, respectively, and with the following globular invertible 3-cells: 
\begin{align*}
 \bar{\omega}&: \bar{\chi} \looseid_{\transid \times \tens}  \horc  \looseid_{\tens}(\looseid_f \times \bar{\chi})   \horc  \alpha^{-1}\looseid_{f \times f \times f} \RRightarrow \looseid_f \alpha^{-1}  \horc  \bar{\chi} \looseid_{\tens \times \transid} \horc  \looseid_{\tens}(\bar{\chi} \times \looseid_f)   \\ 
 \bar{\gamma}&: l^{-1} \looseid_f  \RRightarrow  \looseid_f l^{-1}   \horc \bar{\chi} \looseid_{I \times \transid} \looseid_{i_2} \horc \looseid_{\tens}(\bar{\iota}_f \times \looseid_f) \looseid_{i_2} \\
 \bar{\delta}&: \bar{\chi} \looseid_{\transid \times I} \horc \looseid_{\tens} (\looseid_{f}\times \bar{\iota}) \looseid_{i1} \horc r^{-1} \looseid_f \RRightarrow  \looseid_f r^{-1}   
\end{align*}
satisfying analogous axioms to~\ref{eq:laxfunc1},~\ref{eq:laxfunc2}, but with the cells pasted together in a different order, corresponding to the direction of $\bar{\gamma}, \bar{\delta}$, and $\bar{\omega}$. 

A colax monoidal 1-cell is called {\bf braided}, when $A$ and $B$ are braided and there is a globular 3-cell 
\begin{equation*}
\bar{u}:  \chi  \looseid_{\tau} \horc \sigma_B \looseid_{f \times f} \looseRightarrow  (\looseid_f \sigma_A) \horc \chi 
\end{equation*}
satisfying axioms analogous to the braiding axioms (BHA1) and (BHA2) given in \cite[p141-142]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. Again, the 3-cells of these axioms are pasted in a different order, such that composition of their 2-cell sources and targets is well-defined. 

If $f$ is both lax and colax monoidal, the associated loose 2-cells $\chi$ and $\iota$ form adjoint equivalences with their colax counterparts, and the 3-cells correspond to their colax counterparts as mates under the adjoint equivalence structure, it is {\bf strong monoidal}. Details on the mate correspondences for $\omega$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$ aregiven in the second author's PhD thesis~\cite[B0.7,B0.8,B0.9]{westerthesis}.


A monoidal 1-cell between sylleptic or symmetric objects is {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric}, respectively, if it is braided and the 3-cells defining the braided monoidal structure satisfy an additional axiom analogous to (SHA1) of~\cite[p145]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}.
\end{defn}

By construction, these definitions give the expected results in \fBicat. 
In \fDblf, where there are no nonidentity 3-cells, they reduce to the definitions from section~\ref{sec:symm-mono-double}; and in particular, every syllepsis is a symmetry.

\begin{defn}\label{Def:monverttrans}
Let $f, g:A \onecell B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB. A {\bf lax monoidal 2-cell} $\beta: f \looseRightarrow g$ is a loose 2-cell in \fB\ that is equipped with globular 3-cells
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Pi:  \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta) \horc \chi_g \RRightarrow{} \chi_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{\ten} $
\item $M:  \looseid_{I} \horc \iota_g \RRightarrow{} \iota_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{I_A}$
\end{itemize}
%\begin{comment1}
%This corresponds to $\Pi$ in \cite[Definition 3.6.6]{nick} (Check def. number!) if one writes out the Cartesian product and tight composition of adjoint equivalences (reference?)
%It corresponds to M in \cite[Definition 3.6.6]{nick} up to coherence isomorphisms, if one writes out tight composition. 
%\end{comment1}
such that coherence equations \eqref{eq:mon2cell1}, \eqref{eq:mon2cell2}, and \eqref{eq:mon2cell3} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence} hold. Applied to the special case of bicategories gives us equations (TA2), (TA3) and (TA4) of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}. It is {\bf colax monoidal} if it is equipped with morphisms $\bar{\Pi}, \bar{M}$, which correspond to $\Pi$ and $M$ in the opposite direction, respectively. It is {\bf strong monoidal}, when $\Pi$ and $M$ are isomorphisms
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\bar{\Pi}_{\mbox{lax}}: \chi_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{\ten} \RRightarrow{} \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta) \horc \chi_g$
%\item $\bar{M}_{\mbox{lax}}: \iota_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{I_A} \RRightarrow{} \looseid_{I_B} \horc \iota_g$
%The coherence equations in this case consist of the same 3-cells, but pasted together such that all 3-cells point in the same direction.(?)

A monoidal 2-cell between lax monoidal 1-cells is {\bf braided}, {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric} when $f,g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, and in addition the coherence axiom generalising (BTA1) of~\cite[p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} holds.

Let $f, g:A \onecell B$ be colax monoidal 1-cells in \fB. %A {\bf lax monoidal 2-cell} $\beta: f \looseRightarrow{} g$ is a loose 2-cell in \fB\ that is equipped with globular 3-cells
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\Pi_{\mbox{colax}}: \bar{\chi}_f \horc \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta)   \RRightarrow{} \beta \looseid_{\ten} \horc \bar{\chi}_g$
%\item $M_{\mbox{colax}}: \bar{\iota}_f \horc \looseid_{I} \RRightarrow{} \beta \looseid_{I_A} \horc \bar{\iota}_g$
%\end{itemize}
An {\bf colax monoidal 2-cell} $\beta: f \looseRightarrow{} g$ is a loose 2-cell in \fB\ that is equipped with globular 3-cells
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Pi:  \beta \looseid_{\ten} \hor \bar{\chi}_g   \RRightarrow{}  \bar{\chi}_f \horc \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta)  $
\item $M:  \beta \looseid_{I} \horc \bar{\iota}_g \RRightarrow{} \bar{\iota}_f \horc \looseid_{I} $
\end{itemize}
such that coherence equations analogous to \eqref{eq:mon2cell1}, \eqref{eq:mon2cell2}, and \eqref{eq:mon2cell3} hold, with the same cells pasted together in the order that makes composition of their 2-cell sources and targets well-defined. 

It is {\bf lax monoidal} if it is equipped with 3-cells $\bar{\Pi}$ and $\bar{M}$ that correspond to the 3-cells pointing in the opposite direction of $\Pi$ and $M$,  respectively, such that analogous coherence equations hold with the 3-cells pasted together in a suitable order.

A monoidal 2-cell between colax monoidal 1-cells is {\bf braided}, {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric} when $f,g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, and, in addition, the coherence axiom analogous to~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} holds. In the equation, the 3-cell $u$ is different and therefore the cells are pasted in a different order.


We call a loose 2-cell $\beta$ a {\bf strong monoidal 2-cell} when $\Pi$ and $M$ are isomorphisms. 
\end{defn}

When interpreted in $\fBicat$, monoidal 2-cells should correspond to monoidal pseudo transformations. Such transformations are less general than tritansformations between one-object tricategories. As there is only one fixed object, the constraints $\Pi$ and $M$ are given by icons instead of adjoint equivalences, which leads to the notion of a pseudo-icon~\cite[Definition 5]{gg:ldstr-tricat}, from which the definition above is derived. This notion equals, up to canonical isomorphisms, that of a monoidal pseudo transformation given in~\cite{sp:thesis}. In $\fDblf$, monoidal 2-cells correspond to pseudo double transformations.


As remarked above, we will actually construct a locally cubical bicategory of monoidal objects.
The monoidal 2-cells will be the loose 2-cells therein; we now define the tight 2-morphisms.

\begin{defn}\label{Def:monicon}
  Let $f, g:A \rightarrow B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB.
  A \textbf{monoidal icon} $\beta: f \Rightarrow g$ is a (tight) 2-morphism in \fB\ that is equipped with 3-cells

such that the coherence axioms~\eqref{eq:monicon1},~\eqref{eq:monicon2},~\eqref{eq:monicon3} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence} hold. In the case of bicategories, these axioms specify to (TA2), (TA3) and (TA4) of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}.

If $f, g:A \rightarrow B$ are colax monoidal 1-cells the data for a monoidal icon consists of the same 2-cells between 1-cells in the opposite direction; the coherence equations analogous to~\ref{eq:monicon1},~\ref{eq:monicon2}, and~\ref{eq:monicon3} are  derived by pasting 3-cells together in the order for which the composition of their 2-cell components is well-defined.

A monoidal icon is {\bf braided}, {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric} when $f,g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, respectively, and in addition, the coherence axiom~\ref{eq:brmonicon} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence} holds. 
\end{defn}

Monoidal icons interpreted in $\fBicat$ correspond to ico-icons~\cite[Definition 2]{gg:ldstr-tricat}. These are doubly degenerate colax tritransformations between lax trihomomorphisms which agree on both 0- and 1-cells.

\begin{defn}
  Let $f,g,f',g': A \rightarrow B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells, let $\alpha: f \looseRightarrow{} g$, $\beta: f' \looseRightarrow{} g'$ be lax monoidal 2-cells, and let $\gamma: f \Rightarrow f'$, $\delta: g \Rightarrow g'$ be monoidal icons. A \textbf{monoidal 3-cell} is a 3-cell

If the 1-cells or 2-cells are colax, the 3-cells in the coherence equations are pasted together in a different order, such that composition of the 1-cell and 2-cell components is well-defined.

Let $f,g,f',g', \alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta: g \Rightarrow g'$ be braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 1-cells, 2-cells, and icons, respectively. A \textbf{braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 3-cell} $\Gamma$ as depicted above, is simply a monoidal 3-cell. 
\end{defn}

Monoidal 3-cells in $\fBicat$ correspond to cubical pseudo-icon modifications~\cite[Definition 16]{gg:ldstr-tricat}. When the icon components are identities, this reduces to a monoidal modification~\cite[Definition 2.8]{sp:thesis}. 

We will show that monoidal objects, lax monoidal 1-cells, lax monoidal 2-cells, monoidal icons, and monoidal 3-cells in a locally cubical bicategory \fB\ form a locally cubical bicategory $\cM on_l\fB$. If we consider colax or strong cells instead, we obtain the locally cubical bicategory $\cM on_o\fB$ or $\cM on_s\fB$, respectively. Braided, sylleptic and symmetric cells form locally cubical bicategories $\cB r \cM on_w\fB$, $\cS yl \cM on_w\fB$, and $\cS ym \cM on_w\fB$. Here, $w \in \{l,c,s\}$ denotes whether the cells are lax, colax, or strong.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:dc}
Let $A,B$ be monoidal objects in a locally cubical bicategory with strict composition of 1-cells along 0-cells. The hom-spaces $\cM on_w\fB (A,B)$, $\cB r \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, $\cS yl \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, and $\cS ym \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$ are double categories for $w \in \{l,c,s\}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
First we show that 1-cells and icons in the respective hom-spaces form a category. For each lax monoidal 1-cell $f:A \rightarrow B$, the identity icon $\tightid_f$ is a lax monoidal icon with the 3-cells $N^{\tightid_f} := \tightid_{\iota_f}$ and $\Sigma^{\tightid_f} := \tightid_{\chi_f}$. This is well-defined, because the functor ``$\comp$" preserves tight identities. The coherence equations are trivially satisfied.  For each two lax monoidal 1-cells $f,g$ and lax monoidal icons $\alpha, \beta: f \Rightarrow g$, the composite icon $\beta \verc \alpha$ can be equipped with the lax monoidal structure given by the composites $N^{\beta \verc \alpha} := N^{\beta} \verc N^{\alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha} : = \Sigma^{\beta} \verc \Sigma^{\alpha}$.  We have a strict interchange law between $\verc$ and $\comp$, induced by functoriality of $\comp$, so these 3-cells are well-defined. The coherence conditions~\eqref{eq:monicon1}--\eqref{eq:monicon3} hold by componentwise application of the coherence equalities for $N^{\beta \verc \alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha}$. The same argument holds for colax 1-cells and icons. For strong 1-cells and icons we need to verify that the lax structure cells $N^{\tightid_f}$, $N^{\beta \verc \alpha}, \Sigma^{\tightid_f}$, and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha} $ are inverse in the loose direction to their colax counterparts. For $N^{\tightid_f}$ and $\Sigma^{\tightid_f}$, this follows from functoriality of ``$\horc$". For $N^{\beta \verc \alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha}$, this follows from the the fact that the statement is true for their components combined with the exchange law between ``$\horc$" and ``$\verc$" and strictness of ``$\verc$".
When $f$ and $g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, the same data satisfies the coherence equation for braided monoidal icons.

We also need to show that lax monoidal 2-cells and monoidal 3-cells form a category. For every lax monoidal 2-cell $\alpha: f \looseRightarrow{} g$, the identity 3-cell $\tightid_{\alpha}$ in $\fB$  is lax monoidal. The required two equations~\eqref{eq:mon3cell1},~\eqref{eq:mon3cell2} are trivially satisfied.
For any two monoidal 3-cells $L: \alpha \Rightthreecell \beta$, $K:\beta \Rightthreecell \gamma$, the composition $K \verc L$ in $\fB$ is a monoidal 3-cell. The equations for monoidal 3-cells~\eqref{eq:mon3cell1},~\eqref{eq:mon3cell2} hold by sequential application of the respective equations for $L$ and $K$. The same is true for colax monoidal 2-cells and 3-cells, and hence for strong monoidal 2-cells and 3-cells. As braided, sylleptic, and symmetric monoidal 3-cells are not required to satisfy additional data, it follows that braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 2-cells and 3-cells form a category.

Now we describe the loose structure; we need to show that $\horc$ and $\looseid$ are well-defined as the functors which give the loose structure in the new double category. To see this, recall that $\horc$ and $\looseid$ correspond to the functors $\odot$ and $U$, respectively, given  in Definition~\ref{def:dblcat}.
Let $f$ be a lax monoidal 1-cell. The loose identity 2-cell $\looseid_f$ is a strong monoidal 2-cell with monoidal structure given by the composition of coherence cells $\horl$, $\horr$.

The conditions for monoidal 3-cells follow from the naturality conditions of the coherence cells. 
Let $\gamma$ be a monoidal icon, one can verify that the loose identity 3-cell $\looseid_{\gamma}$ is a monoidal 3-cell: The loose source and target 2-cells of $\looseid_{\gamma}$, are loose identities; hence, the coherence condition holds by naturality of $\horl$ and $\horr$. 

Let $\alpha:f \looseRightarrow{} g$ and $\beta: g \looseRightarrow{} h$ be two lax monoidal 2-cells. Their composition $\alpha \horc \beta$ is lax monoidal with the structure 3-cells given below.

The coherence equations are satisfied by sequential application of the respective equation for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, applications of the exchange law between loose and tight composition, together with simple manipulations of coherence cells.

Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be monoidal 3-cells. Their composite $\Gamma \horc \Delta$ is again monoidal. Again, the conditions for monoidal 3-cells follow directly from the conditions on the monoidal 3-cells $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$, applications of the exchange law between loose and tight composition, and simple manipulations of coherence cells.
By analogous arguments, one can show that the images of $\horc$ and $\looseid$ on colax or strong monoidal cells are well-defined as colax or strong monoidal cells. 

Let $f$ be a braided, sylleptic or symmetric monoidal 1-cell. The loose identity $\looseid_f$ is a braided, sylleptic or symmetric monoidal 2-cell, respectively, as the coherence equation~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} merely states that the 3-cell $u$ pasted with coherence 3-cells equals itself. Let $\alpha, \beta$ be braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 2-cells, the loose composition $\alpha \horc \beta$ is braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal, respectively. One can verify that~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} holds by applying the exchange law between loose and tight composition, manipulation of coherence cells, and sequential application of the respective equations for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  Braided, sylleptic and symmetric monoidal 3-cells are simply monoidal 3-cells; therefore, it follows that the images of $\horc$ and $\looseid$ of braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal cells are well-defined in $\cB r \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, $\cS yl \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, and $\cS ym \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, respectively.

Functoriality of $\horc$ and $\looseid$ in $\cM on \fB(A,B)$ follows from their functoriality in $\fB(A,B)$. 
The unitality and associativity cells $\hora$, $\horl$, and $\horr$ are monoidal 3-cells. Unfolding the constraints for monoidal 3-cells shows that the 3-cells pasted together with coherence cells need to equal themselves. It follows from coherence of the functor $\horc$, that this is the case. Therefore,  $\cM on_w\fB(A,B)$ is a double category for $q \in \{l,c,s\}$. 
Since braided, symmetric, or sylleptic monoidal 3-cells require no extra data, it follows that $\cB r \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, $\cS yl \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$, and $\cS ym \cM on_w\fB(A,B)$ are double categories for $w \in \{l,c,s\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:lcbc}
Let \fB\ be a locally cubical bicategory with strict composition of 1-cells along 0-cells. Monoidal objects, lax monoidal 1-cells, lax monoidal 2-cells, monoidal icons, and monoidal 3-cells in  \fB\ form a locally cubical bicategory $\cM on_l\fB$. 
  If we consider colax or strong cells instead, we obtain the locally cubical bicategory $\cM on_c\fB$ or $\cM on_s\fB$, respectively. When the objects and cells are braided, sylleptic or symmetric,  we obtain the locally cubical bicategories $\cB r \cM on_w\fB$, $\cS yl \cM on_w\fB$, and $\cS ym \cM on_w\fB$, where $w \in \{l,c,s\}$ denotes whether the cells are lax, colax, or strong.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We have established in Proposition~\ref{prop:dc}, that the respective hom-sets $\cM on_w \fB(A,B)$, $\cB r \cM on_w\fB$, $\cS yl \cM on_w\fB$, and $\cS ym \cM on_w\fB$ for $w \in \{l,c,s\}$ form double categories. 

We need to check that the unit $\transid_A$ is a well-defined pseudo double functor from the trivial double category to the respective hom-categories of lax, colax and strong monoidal cells, as well as braided, sylleptic and symmetric cells. 
The unit 1-cells $\transid_A$ are monoidal for all objects $A \in$ \fB,  with the monoidal structure $\xi, \iota$ given by the unitor 2-cells, and $\gamma, \delta$, and $\omega$ by coherence cells for the structure of the double category. The constraints boil down to simple manipulations of coherence cells, which hold by coherence of double categories. By functoriality of $\transid$, its image on the loose 2-cell  is isomorphic to the loose identity $\looseid_{\transid_A}$. This isomorphism gives rise to the following lax monoidal structure on $\transid_{\transid_A}$:

Coherence equations~\ref{eq:mon2cell1}, \ref{eq:mon2cell2}, \ref{eq:mon2cell3}, and~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} hold by simple manipulations of the isomorphisms. This makes $\transid_{\transid_A}$ a braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 2-cells if $\transid_A$ is braided, sylleptic, or symmetric, respectively.
An analogous construction makes $\transid_{\transid_A}$ into an colax monoidal 2-cell. 

By functoriality, the image of $\transid$ on the  tight 2-cell and 3-cell equal $\tightid_{\transid_A}$ and $\looseid_{\tightid_{\transid_A}} = \tightid_{\looseid_{\transid_A}}$, respectively. These cells are braided, symmetric or sylleptic; lax, colax, or strong monoidal, depending on $A$. It follows that $\transid_A$ is a well-defined functor from the trivial double category to the respective hom-categories of lax, colax and strong monoidal cells, as well as braided, sylleptic and symmetric ones.  

Next, we need to show that monoidal structure is preserved by the composition along a 0-cell boundary.
For any two lax monoidal 1-cells $f:A \rightarrow B$, $g:B \rightarrow C$, the composite $g \comp f$ is monoidal with $\chi^{g \comp f}$ and $\iota^{g \comp f}$ defined below. 
\begin{align}
\chi_{g \comp f} &: \hspace{.5cm} &\otimes (gf \times gf) \xlooseRightarrow{\chi_g \looseid_{f \times f}} g \otimes (f \times f) \xlooseRightarrow{\looseid_g \chi_f} gf \tens \\
\iota_{g \comp f} & : \hspace{.5cm} &I_C \xlooseRightarrow{\iota_g} g I_B \xlooseRightarrow{\looseid_g \iota_f} gfI_A
\end{align}

The structure 3-cell $\gamma^{g\circ f}$ for is given below. For readability, we write "$\hspace{5pt}\widehat{}\hspace{5pt}$" to express that we have left out some coherence 3-cells, which are needed to make the source and target of the 3-cell well defined.

Colax and strong monoidal structure 2-cells are obtained in a similar way. 

Let $f,h: A \rightarrow B $ and $g,i: B \rightarrow C$ be lax monoidal 1-cells and let $\alpha: f \rightarrow h$, $\beta: g \rightarrow i$ be monoidal icons, the composite $\beta \comp \alpha$ is monoidal with $N^{\beta \comp \alpha}:= N^{\beta} \horc \looseid_{\beta} N^{\alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \comp \alpha}:= \Sigma^{\beta}\looseid_{\alpha \times \alpha} \horc \looseid_{\beta} \Sigma^{\alpha}$.

When $g,f$ are strong monoidal, the maps $\chi_{g \comp f}$ and $\overline{\chi_{g \comp f}}$ are an adjoint equivalence, constructed by the enriched composition from the adjoint equivalence of the pairs $\chi_g, \overline{\chi_g}$ and $\chi_f, \overline{\chi_f}$. Similarly, $\iota_{g \comp f}$ and $\overline{\iota_{g \comp f}}$ form an adjoint equivalence. One can check that the required pairs of 3-cells correspond to eachother as mates by componentwise application of the adjoint equivalences for the composites of $\iota_{g \comp f}$ and $\chi_{g \comp f}$.

In all coherence equations between 3-cells for the monoidal and braided, sylleptic and symmetric structure of composition above, each 3-cell consists of a component for the first composite  composed with the identity on the second composite, and a component for the second composite composed with the identity on the product of the first composite with itself. This means that the coherence equations for $g \comp f$  can be established by componentwise application of the equations for $g$ and $f$. Some 3-cells also contain coherence cells, but these equally break up in a part concerning the first, and a part concerning the second component. Manipulation of these coherence cells results in the required equalities. Note that rewriting the 1-cells and composites of loose 2-cells is necessary in several of the steps. A similar argument holds for coherence equations for braided, sylleptic and symmetric cells.

Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be two composable monoidal 3-cells. It is easy to see that the composition $\Gamma \comp \Delta$ satisfies the two equations for monoidal 3-cells. This is a matter of applying the equations for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ sequentially.
\end{proof}

 \begin{lem}\label{lem:funcmonob}
Let $F: T \rightarrow S$ be a functor of locally cubical bicategories. If $F$ preserves products, it preserves  monoidal objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells as well as any braided, sylleptic or symmetric structure on the objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells.
 \end{lem}
 
 \begin{proof}
Let $A$ be a monoidal object. As the functor $F$ preserves products, we have a product $F(A) \times_{F} F(A) = F(A \times A)$. As a consequence $\ten\maps
  A\times A\to A$ induces 1-cells $\ten_{F} \maps
 FA\times_{F} F A\to FA$ and $I_{F}:= F(I_A)$. 
 
Since $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ are globular, we have an equality $F(f \comp g) = F(f) \comp F(g)$ for all $f$ and $g$ and for the identity 1-cell we have an equality $F(\transid_A) = \transid_{F(A)}$. The loose associativity 2-cell of $A$ gives rise to a loose 2-cell
  \[\vcenter{\xymatrix@C=6pc{F(A)\times F(A)\times F(A) \rtwocell^{\ten_{F}
        (\Id\times\ten_{F})}_{\ten_{F}(\ten_{F}\times\Id)}{\hspace{.2cm}\fa_{F}\eqv} &F(A) }}\]
  which simply equals $F(\alpha)$ together with the invertible 2-cells.
  
  Likewise, the unit constraints $l, r$ as well as the constraints for (braided) monoidal 1-cells $\sigma$ induce 1-cells $l_{F}, r_{F}$, and $\sigma_{F}$, respectively. Note that the swap functor $\tau$ is mapped by $F$ to the swap functor for the product $\times_{F}$, so $\sigma_{F}$ is well-defined.
  
 Furthermore, the invertible 3-cell filling the Mac Lane pentagon lifts to the invertible 3-cell of the Mac Lane Pentagon for $F(A)$. Which is simply its image under $F$, composed the natural transformations $F_{\odot}$, $\phi$,and $\phi_u$ ensuring that it has the right type.

 Note that there may be several way to past these 3-cells, but by coherence of enriched pseudo functors, the result is the same. Likewise, the isomorphic 3-cells $\mu, \lambda,\rho$ and the isomorphic 3-cells $R,S$, and $v$ witnessing the braiding and syllepsis, lift to the appropriate 3-cell for $F(A)$. This is also the case for the isomorphic 3-cells $R,S$ that characterise the braiding. 
   Finally,  the three equations between pasting composites of $\pi_{F}, \mu_{F}, \lambda_{F}, \rho_{F}$ hold by coherence of enriched pseudo functors.

%Similarly, we prove that $\cT$ preserves braided, sylleptic and symmetric structure. The swap functor $\tau$ is mapped by $\cT$ to the swap functor for the product $\times_{\cT}$. It follows that the braiding 2-cell $\sigma: \tens \looseRightarrow \tens \tau$  gives rise to a braiding 

%\[\vcenter{\xymatrix@C=6pc{\cT(A)\times\cT(A) \rtwocell^{\ten_{\cT}
  %      }_{\ten_{\cT}\tau}{\hspace{.2cm}\sigma_{\cT}\eqv} &\cT(A) }}\]
        
%Analogously to $\alpha$, the invertible globular 3-cells $S, T$, and $\upsilon$ are lifted to their images under $\cT$, augmented with instances of $\phi$ to ensure that the 3-cells have the right type. 

Similarly, one can show that for a monoidal transformation $f$, $F(f)$ is monoidal with structure loose 2-cells $F(\iota_f)$ and $F(\chi_f)$ and 3-cells obtained from $F(\omega),  F(\gamma)$, and $F(\delta)$ analogously to $\alpha$. If $f$ is braided, the braiding of $F(f)$ is witnessed by the 3-cell obtained from $F(u)$. Likewise, $F$ preserves any monoidal, braided, sylleptic and symmetric structure of tight 2-morphisms, loose 2-cells and 3-cells. 
 \end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:lcbcfunctor}
Let $F: \fB  \rightarrow \fC$ be a functor of locally cubical bicategories, such that the tight transformations $\phi$, $\phi_u$ are globular. If $F$ preserves products, then it lifts to the functors below between locally cubical bicategories, for $w \in \{l,o,s\}$.
\begin{align*}
&\cM on_wF: \cM on_w \fB  \rightarrow \cM on_w\fC\\ 
&\cBr \cM on_wF: \cBr \cM on_w \fB  \rightarrow \cBr \cM on_w\fC\\
& \cSyl \cM on_wF: \cSyl \cM on_w \fB  \rightarrow \cSyl \cM on_w\fC\\
&\cSym \cM on_wF: \cSym \cM on_w \fB  \rightarrow \cSym \cM on_w\fC
\end{align*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:funcmonob}, the assignment of $F$ on objects and higher cells is well-defined in the respective categories.
We wil show that functor $F$ gives rise to a pseudo double functor $\cM on_lF: \cM on_l \fB(A, B)  \rightarrow \cM on_l\fC(\cM on_lF(A), \cM on_lF(B))$. The other functors are derived in a similar way. We need to verify that $F(N^{\alpha \verc \beta}) = F(N^{\alpha}) \verc F(N^{\beta})$ and $F(N^{\tightid_f}) = N^{\tightid_{Ff}}$ in $\cM on_l\fC$ and likewise for $\Sigma$. This follows from functoriality of $F$, the fact that $N^{\alpha \verc \beta} = N^{\alpha \verc \beta}$ and $N^{\tightid_f} = \tightid_{\iota_f}$, $F(\iota_f) = \iota_{Ff}$.
The natural transformations $F_{\odot}$ and $F_U$ are well-defined 3-cells in $\cM onD$; the respective equations hold by coherence of the pseudo double functor $F$.
Finally, we need to prove that $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ are well-defined tight transformations in $\cM on \fC(F A, F B)$. Since their components are globular 3-cells, we only need to check that these are monoidal. The equations hold by coherence of enriched functors after expanding the definitions of $M^{F\alpha \comp F \beta}, M^{F(\alpha \comp \beta)}, M^{F(\looseid_f)}$, and $M^{\looseid_{F f}}$ and similarly for $\Pi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:H}
The functor $\cH: \fDblf \rightarrow \fBicat$ lifts to the functors $\cM on_w \cH: \cMon_w\fDblf \rightarrow \cMon_w \fBicat$, $\cBr_w \cH: \cBr_w\fDblf \rightarrow \cBr_w \fBicat$,  $\cSyl_w\cH: \cSyl_w\fDblf \rightarrow \cSyl_w\fBicat$, and $\cSym_w \cH: \cSym_w\fDblf \rightarrow \cSym_w \fBicat$ for $w\in \{l,o,s\}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Note that in the case of $\cH$, $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ have globular components. The result then follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:lcbcfunctor}
