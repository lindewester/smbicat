\section{Monoidal objects in locally cubical bicategories}
\label{sec:mono-objects}


%Moreover, we want $\cH$ to act on monoidal morphisms between such monoidal objects, and indeed to extend to a functor between categories of monoidal objects.
%It would be nice if this enhanced functor $\cH$ could stay entirely in the world of iconic tricategories (that is, \Icon-enriched bicategories); but unfortunately the usual composition of monoidal functors between monoidal bicategories is not strictly associative, so they do not form an iconic tricategory.

%However, they do form a more general structure, namely a bicategory enriched over \cDbl; in~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} this is called a \textbf{locally cubical bicategory}.
%Since any bicategory can be regarded as a double category with only identity tight 1-morphisms, any iconic tricategory can be regarded as a locally cubical bicategory, but the latter are more general.
%In addition to the objects, 1-morphisms, 2-cells (now called ``loose 2-cells''), and 3-cells (now called ``globular 3-cells'') of an iconic tricategory, a locally cubical bicategory contains \emph{tight} 2-morphisms, and square-shaped 3-cells.
%The composition of 1-morphisms in a locally cubical bicategory is associative only up to an invertible \emph{tight} 2-morphism. One of the results of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} is that monoidal bicategories form a locally cubical bicategory. 
%We will generalize this theorem to monoidal objects, perhaps braided, sylleptic and symmetric, in any iconic tricategory with finite products --- and indeed, in any locally cubical bicategory with finite products.

%Since \cDbl, like \Icon, is a cartesian monoidal 2-category, we can define what it means for a locally cubical bicategory to have finite products, and this property is preserved when regarding an iconic tricategory as a locally cubical bicategory.
%In particular, this applies to \cDblf\ and to \cBicat\ --- but actually, in place of the iconic tricategory \cBicat\ considered up until now we will focus instead on the locally cubical bicategory of bicategories constructed in~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}, whose ``locally loose part'' is \cBicat, but whose tight 2-cells are \emph{icons}.
%We denote this by \fBicat; it is easy to see that it also has products preserved by the inclusion $\cBicat\to \fBicat$, so that the composite functor $\cH : \cDblf \to\fBicat$ still preserves products.
We now move on to define an appropriate abstract sort of ``monoidal objects'', that will be preserved by the product-preserving functor $\cH$, and that specializes to monoidal double categories and to monoidal bicategories. 
Such structures are obtained by abstracting the definitions of monoidal, braided, and symmetric structure for bicategories given in~\cite{nick:tricatsbook},~\cite{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}, and~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}. 
Under this translation pseudonatural transformations become \emph{loose} 2-cells and modifications become globular 3-cells.
Recall that the loose 2-cells in \fDblf\ (which has no nonidentity tight 2-morphisms) are the (tight) transformations, while those in \fBicat\ are exactly the pseudonatural transformations (its tight 2-morphisms are icons).
We will define monoidal, braided, sylleptic and symmetric objects, 1-cell, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells by taking instances of bicategories, functors, pseudonatural transformations, and modifications in the original definitions as objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells, respectively. 

Before we give the definitions of monoidal cells, we unfold the structure of a locally cubical bicategory and fix our notation. In addition to objects, locally cubical bicategories have 4 different elements, which together form the hom-double categories. We call the objects, loose 1-cells, tight 1-cells, and 2-morphisms of the hom-double category '1-cells', 'loose 2-cells', 'tight 2-cells' and '3-cells' of the locally cubical bicategory, respectively. The structure contains three types of composition. We will adopt the notation introduced for intercategories~\cite{gp:intercategories-i}, of which locally cubical bicategories are a special case. Firstly, we have loose composition ``$\horc$" within the hom- double categories. This gives us composition of loose 2-cells along a 1-cell boundary and of 3-cells along a tight 2-cell boundary. We write this composition in the order of diagrammatic composition: $\alpha \horc \beta$, meaning ``$\beta$ after $\alpha$". We write $\looseid_{f}$ and $\looseid_{\alpha}$ for the loose identity on a 1-cell $f$ and a tight 2-cell $\alpha$, respectively. Loose composition is weakly associative and loose identities hold up to isomorphism. 
Secondly, we have tight composition ``$\verc$" in the hom-double categories. This gives us composition of tight 2-cells along a 1-cell boundary and tight composition of 3-cells along a loose 2-cell boundary, written in the conventional order: $f \verc g$ denoting ``$f$ after $g$". We write $\tightid_f$ and $\tightid_{\alpha}$ for the tight identity on a 1-cell $f$ and a loose 2-cell $\alpha$, respectively; we denote the associator, left and right unitor for $\hor$ by $\hora, \horr, \horl$, respectively. Tight composition is strictly associative and has strict identities. 
Thirdly, there is composition ``$\comp$" of 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells along a 0-cell boundary, given by the enriched structure. We write this composition in the conventional order: $f \comp g$ meaning ``$f$ after $g$". When it is clear from the context, we omit the composition symbol ``$\comp$",  and write the juxtaposition of 1-cells instead. The identities for this composition are denoted by ``$\transid$". We denote the associator, left and right unitor for $\comp$ by $\compa, \compr, \compl$, respectively.
We write ``$\onecell$" to denote 1-cells, ``$\looseRightarrow$" to denote the loose 2-cells, ``$\Rightarrow$" to denote the tight 2-cells and ``$\RRightarrow$" to denote $3$-cells.

For readability, we will implicitly strictify the hom-double categories, as we did with the double categories in Section~\ref{sec:symm-mono-double}, except where we prove that this structure is preserved by monoidal cells. As a consequence, we omit the associativity and unit constraints for $\horc$ in various places.
Note that $\verc$ is always strictly associative and unital.
Composition $\comp$ along 0-cells is not strict, but we will restrict our input locally cubical bicategories by assuming that composition of \emph{1-cells} along 0-cells is strict, in the following precise sense:

\begin{defn}\label{defn:1strict}
  A locally cubical bicategory is \textbf{1-strict} if the tight transformations $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\rho$ from \cref{def:lcbc} are globular, i.e.\ their tight 1-cell components are identities.
  Similarly, a functor of locally cubical bicategories is \textbf{1-strict} if the tight transformations $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ from \cref{def:lcbcfunc} are globular.
\end{defn}

Our primary examples $\fDblf$ and $\fBicat$ are 1-strict, as is the functor $\cH:\fDblf\to\fBicat$.
However, while $\fDblf$ is completely strict (being a strict 2-category regarded as a locally cubical bicategory in the 2-loose direction), the composition $\comp$ in $\fBicat$ is not fully strict, i.e.\ the transformations $\alpha,\lambda,\rho$ are not identities: their nonidentity 2-cell components arise from the pseudonaturality constraints of the loose 2-cells in $\fBicat$.

A 1-strict locally cubical bicategory is almost exactly an abstraction of the structure and level of strictness possessed by bicategories, functors, pseudonatural transformations, and icons.
This enables an almost-literal transposition of definition from the world of bicategories, as long as the monoidal constraints and coherence axioms are reformulated in equational form instead of their original diagrammatic expression of 2-cell composites in the target bicategory.

There is one other difference: a locally cubical bicategory contains a unique basic operation of ``composing two loose 2-cells along a 0-cell'', whereas when composing two pseudonatural transformations of bicategories
\[ \xymatrix{ \cA \rtwocell^F_G{\alpha} & \cB \rtwocell^H_K{\beta} & \cC } \]
we have to choose whether the component of $\beta\circ\alpha$ at $a\in \cA$ should be the top-right composite or the left-bottom composite in the following square:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    H F a \ar[r,"H \alpha_a"] \ar[d,"\beta_{F a}"'] \ar[dr,phantom,"\cong"] & H G a \ar[d,"\beta_{G a}"]\\
    K F a \ar[r,"K \alpha_a"'] & K G a.
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
The two choices are isomorphic (the square is a pseudonaturality constraint for $\beta$), but neither of them is canonically ``the'' choice.
This ambiguity is not in itself a problem; the real issue it reflects is that the locally cubical bicategory $\fBicat$ does not have a basic way to express the operation of ``whiskering'' a pseudonatural transformation by a functor on either side.
We can compose  along an object with a loose identity 2-cell, but since bicategories are only weakly unital, the result is only \emph{isomorphic} to the ``basic'' operation of whiskering for bicategories.
In particular, bicategories are strict in one way that is invisible to $\fBicat$: whiskering is also strictly associative, e.g.\ $H(F(\gamma)) = (H\circ F)(\gamma)$, but $\fBicat$ can only express the isomorphism $\looseid_{H}\circ (\looseid_{F}\circ \gamma) \cong \looseid_{H \circ F} \circ \gamma$ which is \emph{not} a strict equality.
This means that certain additional isomorphisms have to be inserted in our definitions of monoidal objects that are not present in the explicit definitions of monoidal bicategories.

One solution to this problem would be to define a locally-cubical-type structure analogous to the \emph{bicategory-enriched categories} of~\cite{verity:base-change}, which use a multicategory structure to express whiskering as a basic operation (just as is done in the strict case with Gray-categories~\cite{gps:tricats}).
However, probably a better use of time would be to extend our definitions to locally cubical bicategories that are not even 1-strict, such as the locally cubical bicategory of \emph{monoidal} bicategories and its relatives (i.e.\ the \emph{outputs} of our construction).
This is more subtle than it may appear, since the coherence axioms of a monoidal bicategory involve pasting together loose 2-cells along boundary 1-cells that are strictly equal in a 1-strict locally cubical bicategory, but only related by a \emph{tight} isomorphism in the general case; thus even to write down the definitions the general case would already require some fibrancy in the hom-double-categories.

One further note about our definitions is that certain constraint 2-cells are suppressed in~\cite{nick:tricatsbook},~\cite{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}, and~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat} to simplify notation, but in the equational form below, this cannot be done; thus the coherence equations look more intimidating, but in fact are not more complicated than their bicategorical counterparts.

Let \fB\ be a 1-strict locally cubical bicategory with products.
We give the coherence axioms for monoidal objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells explicitly, but leave the axioms for braided, symmetric and sylleptic monoidal structures as an exercise for the reader.

\begin{defn}
A {\bf monoidal object} in \fB\ is an object $A$, equipped with 1-cells $\otimes: A \times A \onecell A$ and $I_A: * \onecell A$, and 2-cells
\begin{itemize} 
\item $\alpha: \mathord{\ten} (\mathord{\tens} \times \id) \looseRightarrow{} \mathord{\ten}  (\id \times \mathord{\tens}) $
\item $l: \mathord{\ten} (I \times \transid) i_2 \looseRightarrow{} \transid$ and $r: \mathord{\ten} (\transid \times I) i_1 \looseRightarrow{} \transid$ 
\end{itemize}
where $*$ is the terminal object of $\fB$ and $i_1: A \rightarrow A \times *$, $i_2: A \rightarrow 
* \times A$ are the canonical isomorphisms. Finally, it must be equipped with the invertible globular 3-cells $\pi, \mu, \lambda, \rho$ depicted below, which generalise the Mac Lane pentagon and the three other coherence diagrams given in Definition 4.1 of~\cite{nick:tricatsbook}. The horizontally drawn equality is added for readability. These 3-cells must satisfy the three axioms~These 3-cells must satisfy the three axioms~\eqref{eq:monobjeq1},~\eqref{eq:monobjeq2}~\eqref{eq:monobjeq3} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence}, which generalise the coherence axioms for monoidal bicategories~\cite[Definition 4.1]{nick:tricatsbook}.

A monoidal object is {\bf braided} if, in addition, it is equipped with a loose 2-cell $\sigma_A: \tens \looseRightarrow{} \mathord{\ten} \tau$, where $\tau: A \times A \rightarrow A \times A$ interchanges the two copies of $A$; and if there are invertible globular 3-cells 
\input{R}
\input{S}
satisfying axioms analogous to (BA1), (BA2), (BA3), and (BA4) given in~\cite[p136--139]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} . 
It is {\bf sylleptic} when it is additionally equipped with an invertible globular 3-cell
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
 \node (tl) at (-2,1) {\scriptsize$\ten$};
 \node (tr) at (2,1) {\scriptsize$\ten$};
 \node (b) at (0,-.25) {\scriptsize$\tens \tau$};
 \draw[double] (tl)  -- (tr);
 \draw[doubleloose] (tl) to node[left, yshift=-5pt]{\scriptsize$\sigma$} (b);
 \draw[doubleloose] (b) to node[right, yshift=-5pt] {\scriptsize$\sigma$}(tr);
 \node at (0,0.5) {\scriptsize $\DDownarrow \upsilon \iso$}; 
 \end{tikzpicture}
 \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
  satisfying the axioms analogous to (SA1), (SA2) on~\cite[p144--145]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. It is {\bf symmetric} if in addition, it satisfies the axiom analogous to the equation given on~\cite[p91]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}.
\end{defn}

We now define monoidal 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells.
As in the 1-categorical case, a morphism (1-cell) between monoidal objects can be lax, colax, or strong, corresponding to the direction of the comparison morphisms relating $fa \ten fb$ to $f(a\ten b)$.
But there is no need to define the two independently, as they are related by the duality $\fB\lco$ from \autoref{rmk:lcbop} that reverses loose 2-cells.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:lax-1cell}
Let $A,B$ be monoidal objects in \fB. A 1-cell $f:A \onecell B$ is {\bf lax monoidal} when it is equipped with the following loose 2-cells:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\chi: \mathord{\ten} (f \times f) \looseRightarrow{} f  \mathord{\otimes}$
\item $\iota: I_B \looseRightarrow{} fI_A $
\end{itemize}
as well as globular invertible 3-cells 
%remember that we write the horizontal composition \horc in diagrammatic order!
\begin{align*}
& \omega:  \looseid_{\tens}(\chi \times \looseid_f)  \horc  \chi\looseid_{\tens \times \transid} \horc  \looseid_f \alpha \RRightarrow \alpha\looseid_{f \times f \times f}  \horc \looseid_{\tens}(\looseid \times \chi)  \horc \chi \looseid_{\transid \times \tens}  \\
 &\gamma: \looseid_{\tens}(\iota_f \times \looseid_f) \looseid_{i_2} \horc \chi \looseid_{I \times \transid} \looseid_{i_2} \horc \looseid_f l\RRightarrow l \looseid_f \\
 &\delta:  \looseid_f r^{-1} \RRightarrow r^{-1} \looseid_f \horc \looseid_{\tens} (\looseid \times \iota) \looseid_{i_1 f} \horc \chi \looseid_{(\transid \times I)i_1}
\end{align*}
which satisfy the two axioms~\eqref{eq:laxfunc1},~\eqref{eq:laxfunc2} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence}, expressing the usual associativity and unitality conditions~\cite[Definition 4.10]{nick:tricatsbook}.

If $A$ and $B$ are braided, then $f$ is called {\bf braided} when there is a globular 3-cell 
\begin{equation*}
u: \sigma_B \looseid_{f \times f} \horc \chi  \looseid_{\tau} \looseRightarrow \chi \horc (\looseid_f \sigma_A)
\end{equation*}
satisfying braiding axioms analogous to (BHA1) and (BHA2) given in~\cite[p141-142]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. 
If $A$ and $B$ are sylleptic or symmetric, then $f$ is {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric}, respectively, if it is braided and the 3-cells defining the braided monoidal structure satisfy an additional axiom analogous to (SHA1) of~\cite[p145]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}.

A \textbf{(braided, sylleptic, or symmetric) colax monoidal 1-cell} in \fB is simply a lax one in $\fB\lco$.
Thus it is equipped with loose 2-cells $\bar{\chi}$ and $\bar{\iota}$ which go in the opposite direction of $\chi$ and $\iota$, respectively, and appropriate invertible 3-cells.
% \begin{align*}
%  \bar{\omega}&: \bar{\chi} \looseid_{\transid \times \tens}  \horc  \looseid_{\tens}(\looseid_f \times \bar{\chi})   \horc  \alpha^{-1}\looseid_{f \times f \times f} \RRightarrow \looseid_f \alpha^{-1}  \horc  \bar{\chi} \looseid_{\tens \times \transid} \horc  \looseid_{\tens}(\bar{\chi} \times \looseid_f)   \\ 
%  \bar{\gamma}&: l^{-1} \looseid_f  \RRightarrow  \looseid_f l^{-1}   \horc \bar{\chi} \looseid_{I \times \transid} \looseid_{i_2} \horc \looseid_{\tens}(\bar{\iota}_f \times \looseid_f) \looseid_{i_2} \\
%  \bar{\delta}&: \bar{\chi} \looseid_{\transid \times I} \horc \looseid_{\tens} (\looseid_{f}\times \bar{\iota}) \looseid_{i1} \horc r^{-1} \looseid_f \RRightarrow  \looseid_f r^{-1}   
% \end{align*}
% satisfying analogous axioms to~\ref{eq:laxfunc1},~\ref{eq:laxfunc2}, but with the cells pasted together in a different order, corresponding to the direction of $\bar{\gamma}, \bar{\delta}$, and $\bar{\omega}$. 

% A colax monoidal 1-cell is called {\bf braided}, when $A$ and $B$ are braided and there is a globular 3-cell 
% \begin{equation*}
% \bar{u}:  \chi  \looseid_{\tau} \horc \sigma_B \looseid_{f \times f} \looseRightarrow  (\looseid_f \sigma_A) \horc \chi 
% \end{equation*}
% satisfying axioms analogous to the braiding axioms (BHA1) and (BHA2) given in \cite[p141-142]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb}. Again, the 3-cells of these axioms are pasted in a different order, such that composition of their 2-cell sources and targets is well-defined. 

If $f$ is both lax and colax monoidal, the associated loose 2-cells $\chi$ and $\iota$ form adjoint equivalences with their colax counterparts, and the 3-cells correspond to their colax counterparts as mates under the adjoint equivalence structure, it is {\bf strong monoidal}. Details on the mate correspondences for $\omega$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$ aregiven in the second author's PhD thesis~\cite[B0.7,B0.8,B0.9]{westerthesis}.
\end{defn}

By construction, these definitions give the expected results in \fBicat. 
In \fDblf, where there are no nonidentity 3-cells, they reduce to the definitions from section~\ref{sec:symm-mono-double}; and in particular, every syllepsis is a symmetry.

Note also that since there are no tight 2-cells in \autoref{defn:lax-1cell} and all the 3-cells are isomorphisms, lax monoidal 1-cells in the tight 2-cell dual $\fB\tco$ coincide with those in $\fB$ itself.

For ordinary monoidal categories, once a type of 1-cell (lax, colax, strong) is fixed, there is only one kind of 2-cell between them.
But for monoidal bicategories, a 2-cell can also be lax, colax, or strong at the 2-dimensional level, independently of whether its domain and codomain 1-cells are lax, colax, or strong.
(This has nothing to do with laxity of its underlying natural transformation; for us these are always strong, i.e.\ pseudonatural.)
But again, there is no need to define them independently, as they are related by the other duality $\fB\tco$ that reverses the tight 2-cells.

\begin{defn}\label{Def:mon1cell}
Let $f, g:A \onecell B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB. A {\bf lax monoidal 2-cell} $\beta: f \looseRightarrow g$ is a loose 2-cell in \fB\ that is equipped with globular 3-cells
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Pi:  \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta) \horc \chi_g \RRightarrow{} \chi_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{\ten} $
\item $M:  \looseid_{I} \horc \iota_g \RRightarrow{} \iota_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{I_A}$
\end{itemize}
%\begin{comment1}
%This corresponds to $\Pi$ in \cite[Definition 3.6.6]{nick} (Check def. number!) if one writes out the Cartesian product and tight composition of adjoint equivalences (reference?)
%It corresponds to M in \cite[Definition 3.6.6]{nick} up to coherence isomorphisms, if one writes out tight composition. 
%\end{comment1}
such that coherence equations \eqref{eq:mon2cell1}, \eqref{eq:mon2cell2}, and \eqref{eq:mon2cell3} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence} hold. Applied to the special case of bicategories this gives us equations (TA2), (TA3) and (TA4) of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}.

Such a 2-cell is {\bf braided}, {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric} when $f,g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, and, in addition, the coherence axiom analogous to~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} holds.
% In the colax case, the 3-cell $u$ is different and therefore the cells are pasted in a different order.

A {\bf colax monoidal 2-cell} between lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB is a lax monoidal 2-cell in $\fB\tco$; thus it is equipped with morphisms $\bar{\Pi}, \bar{M}$ in the opposite direction from $\Pi$ and $M$.
A {\bf strong monoidal 2-cell} is a lax (or equivalently colax) one for which $\Pi$ and $M$ are isomorphisms.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\bar{\Pi}_{\mbox{lax}}: \chi_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{\ten} \RRightarrow{} \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta) \horc \chi_g$
%\item $\bar{M}_{\mbox{lax}}: \iota_f \horc \beta  \looseid_{I_A} \RRightarrow{} \looseid_{I_B} \horc \iota_g$
%The coherence equations in this case consist of the same 3-cells, but pasted together such that all 3-cells point in the same direction.(?)

If instead $f,g$ are colax monoidal 1-cells in \fB, then a \textbf{lax monoidal 2-cell} between them is a lax monoidal 2-cell between $f,g$ regarded as lax monoidal 1-cells in $\fB\lco$, while a \textbf{colax monoidal 2-cell} is a lax monoidal 2-cell between $f,g$ regarded as lax monoidal 2-cells in $\fB\tlco$.
\end{defn}

% Let $f, g:A \onecell B$ be colax monoidal 1-cells in \fB. %A {\bf lax monoidal 2-cell} $\beta: f \looseRightarrow{} g$ is a loose 2-cell in \fB\ that is equipped with globular 3-cells
% %\begin{itemize}
% %\item $\Pi_{\mbox{colax}}: \bar{\chi}_f \horc \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta)   \RRightarrow{} \beta \looseid_{\ten} \horc \bar{\chi}_g$

% %\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\Pi:  \beta \looseid_{\ten} \hor \bar{\chi}_g   \RRightarrow{}  \bar{\chi}_f \horc \looseid_{\ten}(\beta \times \beta)  $
% \item $M:  \beta \looseid_{I} \horc \bar{\iota}_g \RRightarrow{} \bar{\iota}_f \horc \looseid_{I} $
% \end{itemize}
% such that coherence equations analogous to \eqref{eq:mon2cell1}, \eqref{eq:mon2cell2}, and \eqref{eq:mon2cell3} hold, with the same cells pasted together in the order that makes composition of their 2-cell sources and targets well-defined. 

% It is {\bf lax monoidal} if it is equipped with 3-cells $\bar{\Pi}$ and $\bar{M}$ that correspond to the 3-cells pointing in the opposite direction of $\Pi$ and $M$,  respectively, such that analogous coherence equations hold with the 3-cells pasted together in a suitable order.

When interpreted in $\fBicat$, monoidal 2-cells correspond to monoidal pseudonatural transformations. Such transformations are less general than tritansformations between one-object tricategories; they are obtained by restricting the constraints $\Pi$ and $M$ in a tritransformation to be given by icons instead of adjoint equivalences, leading to the notion of a pseudo-icon~\cite[Definition 5]{gg:ldstr-tricat} from which the definition above is derived. This notion equals, up to canonical isomorphisms, that of a monoidal pseudo transformation given in~\cite{sp:thesis}. In $\fDblf$, monoidal 2-cells correspond to monoidal double transformations.


As remarked above, we will actually construct a locally cubical bicategory of monoidal objects.
The monoidal 2-cells will be the loose 2-cells therein; we now define the tight ones and the 3-cells.

\begin{defn}\label{Def:monicon}
  Let $f, g:A \rightarrow B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells in \fB.
  A \textbf{monoidal icon} $\beta: f \Rightarrow g$ is a (tight) 2-morphism in \fB\ that is equipped with (non-globular!)\ 3-cells

\end{equation}
such that the coherence axioms~\eqref{eq:monicon1},~\eqref{eq:monicon2},~\eqref{eq:monicon3} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence} hold. In the case of bicategories, these axioms specialize to (TA2), (TA3) and (TA4) of~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}.

A monoidal icon is {\bf braided}, {\bf sylleptic} or {\bf symmetric} when $f,g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, respectively, and in addition, the coherence axiom~\eqref{eq:brmonicon} in Appendix~\ref{ap:coherence} holds. 

If $f, g:A \rightarrow B$ are instead colax monoidal 1-cells, a \textbf{monoidal icon} between them is a monoidal icon between $f,g$ regarded as lax monoidal 1-cells in $\fB\lco$.
 % the data for a monoidal icon consists of the same 2-cells between 1-cells in the opposite direction; the coherence equations analogous to~\ref{eq:monicon1},~\ref{eq:monicon2}, and~\ref{eq:monicon3} are  derived by pasting 3-cells together in the order for which the composition of their 2-cell components is well-defined.
\end{defn}

Monoidal icons interpreted in $\fBicat$ correspond to ico-icons~\cite[Definition 2]{gg:ldstr-tricat}. These are doubly degenerate colax tritransformations between lax trihomomorphisms which agree on both 0- and 1-cells.
In $\fDblf$, since there are no nonidentity tight 2-cells, there are no nonidentity monoidal icons.
Note that a monoidal icon $f\to g$ in $\fB\tco$ is the same as a monoidal icon $g\to f$ in $\fB$.

\begin{defn}
  Let $f,g,f',g': A \rightarrow B$ be lax monoidal 1-cells, let $\alpha: f \looseRightarrow{} g$, $\beta: f' \looseRightarrow{} g'$ be lax monoidal 2-cells, and let $\gamma: f \Rightarrow f'$, $\delta: g \Rightarrow g'$ be monoidal icons. A \textbf{monoidal 3-cell} is a 3-cell

% If the 1-cells or 2-cells are colax, the 3-cells in the coherence equations are pasted together in a different order, such that composition of the 1-cell and 2-cell components is well-defined.

If $f,g,f',g', \alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta: g \Rightarrow g'$ are braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 1-cells, 2-cells, and icons, respectively, then a \textbf{braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 3-cell} $\Gamma$ as depicted above, is simply a monoidal 3-cell. 
\end{defn}

Monoidal 3-cells in $\fBicat$ correspond to cubical pseudo-icon modifications~\cite[Definition 16]{gg:ldstr-tricat}. When the icon components are identities, this reduces to a monoidal modification~\cite[Definition 2.8]{sp:thesis}. 

We will show that monoidal objects, lax monoidal 1-cells, lax monoidal 2-cells, monoidal icons, and monoidal 3-cells in a locally cubical bicategory \fB\ form a locally cubical bicategory $\cM on_{ll}\fB$.
The first subscript $l$ indicates the laxity of the 1-cells, the second that of the loose 2-cells; in the colax case we write $c$ and in the strong case $p$ (for ``pseudo'' --- the subscript $s$ is usually used in 2-category theory instead for ``strict'').
We write $v,w \in \{l,c,p\}$ for unspecified ``laxness annotations''.
Thus by definition we will have
\begin{align*}
  \cMon_{cl}(\fB) &= \cMon_{ll}(\fB\lco)\\
  \cMon_{lc}(\fB) &= \cMon_{ll}(\fB\tco)\tco\\
  \cMon_{cc}(\fB) &= \cMon_{ll}(\fB\tlco)\tco.
\end{align*}
Similarly, braided, sylleptic and symmetric cells will form locally cubical bicategories $\cB r \cM on_{vw}\fB$, $\cS yl \cM on_{vw}\fB$, and $\cS ym \cM on_{vw}\fB$.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:dc}
Let $A,B$ be monoidal objects in a 1-strict locally cubical bicategory with products. The hom-spaces $\cM on_{vw}\fB (A,B)$, $\cB r \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, $\cS yl \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, and $\cS ym \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$ are double categories for $v,w \in \{l,c,p\}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
By duality, the colax cases are implied by the lax ones.
The pseudo 2-cell cases are generally trivial (the property of invertibility is always preserved), but the pseudo 1-cell cases require carrying through the adjoint equivalence data.

First we show that 1-cells and icons in the respective hom-spaces form a category. For each lax monoidal 1-cell $f:A \rightarrow B$, the identity icon $\tightid_f$ is a lax monoidal icon with the 3-cells $N^{\tightid_f} := \tightid_{\iota_f}$ and $\Sigma^{\tightid_f} := \tightid_{\chi_f}$. This is well-defined, because the functor ``$\comp$" preserves tight identities. The coherence equations are trivially satisfied.  For each two lax monoidal 1-cells $f,g$ and lax monoidal icons $\alpha, \beta: f \Rightarrow g$, the composite icon $\beta \verc \alpha$ can be equipped with the lax monoidal structure given by the composites $N^{\beta \verc \alpha} := N^{\beta} \verc N^{\alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha} : = \Sigma^{\beta} \verc \Sigma^{\alpha}$.  We have a strict interchange law between $\verc$ and $\comp$, induced by functoriality of $\comp$, so these 3-cells are well-defined. The coherence conditions~\eqref{eq:monicon1}--\eqref{eq:monicon3} hold by componentwise application of the coherence equalities for $N^{\beta \verc \alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha}$.

The colax case follows by duality.
For strong 1-cells and icons we need to verify that the lax structure cells $N^{\tightid_f}$, $N^{\beta \verc \alpha}, \Sigma^{\tightid_f}$, and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha} $ are inverse in the loose direction to their colax counterparts. For $N^{\tightid_f}$ and $\Sigma^{\tightid_f}$, this follows from functoriality of ``$\horc$". For $N^{\beta \verc \alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \verc \alpha}$, this follows from the the fact that the statement is true for their components combined with the exchange law between ``$\horc$" and ``$\verc$" and strictness of ``$\verc$".
When $f$ and $g$ are braided, sylleptic or symmetric, the same data satisfies the coherence equation for braided monoidal icons.

We also need to show that lax monoidal 2-cells and monoidal 3-cells form a category. For every lax monoidal 2-cell $\alpha: f \looseRightarrow{} g$, the identity 3-cell $\tightid_{\alpha}$ in $\fB$  is lax monoidal. The required two equations~\eqref{eq:mon3cell1},~\eqref{eq:mon3cell2} are trivially satisfied.
For any two monoidal 3-cells $L: \alpha \Rightthreecell \beta$, $K:\beta \Rightthreecell \gamma$, the composition $K \verc L$ in $\fB$ is a monoidal 3-cell. The equations for monoidal 3-cells~\eqref{eq:mon3cell1},~\eqref{eq:mon3cell2} hold by sequential application of the respective equations for $L$ and $K$.
The colax and strong cases follow automatically, and similarly the braided, sylleptic, and symmetric cases since in this case the 3-cells have no additional data.

Now we describe the loose structure; we need to show that $\horc$ and $\looseid$ are well-defined as the functors which give the loose structure in the new double category. To see this, recall that $\horc$ and $\looseid$ correspond to the functors $\odot$ and $U$, respectively, given  in Definition~\ref{def:dblcat}.
Let $f$ be a lax monoidal 1-cell. The loose identity 2-cell $\looseid_f$ is a strong monoidal 2-cell with monoidal structure given by the composition of coherence cells $\horl$, $\horr$.

The conditions for monoidal 3-cells follow from the naturality conditions of the coherence cells. 
Let $\gamma$ be a monoidal icon, one can verify that the loose identity 3-cell $\looseid_{\gamma}$ is a monoidal 3-cell: The loose source and target 2-cells of $\looseid_{\gamma}$, are loose identities; hence, the coherence condition holds by naturality of $\horl$ and $\horr$. 

Let $\alpha:f \looseRightarrow{} g$ and $\beta: g \looseRightarrow{} h$ be two lax monoidal 2-cells. Their composition $\alpha \horc \beta$ is lax monoidal with the structure 3-cells given below.

The coherence equations are satisfied by sequential application of the respective equation for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, applications of the exchange law between loose and tight composition, together with simple manipulations of coherence cells.

Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be monoidal 3-cells. Their composite $\Gamma \horc \Delta$ is again monoidal. Again, the conditions for monoidal 3-cells follow directly from the conditions on the monoidal 3-cells $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$, applications of the exchange law between loose and tight composition, and simple manipulations of coherence cells.
The colax and strong cases follow automatically.
% By analogous arguments, one can show that the images of $\horc$ and $\looseid$ on colax or strong monoidal cells are well-defined as colax or strong monoidal cells. 

Let $f$ be a braided, sylleptic or symmetric monoidal 1-cell. The loose identity $\looseid_f$ is a braided, sylleptic or symmetric monoidal 2-cell, respectively, as the coherence equation~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} merely states that the 3-cell $u$ pasted with coherence 3-cells equals itself. Let $\alpha, \beta$ be braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 2-cells, the loose composition $\alpha \horc \beta$ is braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal, respectively. One can verify that~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} holds by applying the exchange law between loose and tight composition, manipulation of coherence cells, and sequential application of the respective equations for $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  Braided, sylleptic and symmetric monoidal 3-cells are simply monoidal 3-cells; therefore, it follows that the images of $\horc$ and $\looseid$ of braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal cells are well-defined in $\cB r \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, $\cS yl \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, and $\cS ym \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, respectively.

Functoriality of $\horc$ and $\looseid$ in $\cM on \fB(A,B)$ follows from their functoriality in $\fB(A,B)$. 
The unitality and associativity cells $\hora$, $\horl$, and $\horr$ are monoidal 3-cells. Unfolding the constraints for monoidal 3-cells shows that the 3-cells pasted together with coherence cells need to equal themselves. It follows from coherence of the functor $\horc$, that this is the case. Therefore,  $\cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$ is a double category for $v,w \in \{l,c,p\}$. 
Since braided, symmetric, or sylleptic monoidal 3-cells require no extra data, it follows that $\cB r \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, $\cS yl \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$, and $\cS ym \cM on_{vw}\fB(A,B)$ are double categories for $v,w \in \{l,c,p\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:lcbc}
Let \fB\ be a 1-strict locally cubical bicategory with products. Monoidal objects, lax monoidal 1-cells, lax monoidal 2-cells, monoidal icons, and monoidal 3-cells in  \fB\ form a locally cubical bicategory $\cMon_{ll}\fB$, and similarly we have $\cMon_{vw}\fB$ for $v,w\in \{l,c,p\}$.
%If we consider colax or strong cells instead, we obtain the locally cubical bicategory $\cM on_c\fB$ or $\cM on_p\fB$, respectively.
When the objects and cells are braided, sylleptic or symmetric,  we obtain the locally cubical bicategories $\cB r \cM on_{vw}\fB$, $\cS yl \cM on_{vw}\fB$, and $\cS ym \cM on_{vw}\fB$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We have established in Proposition~\ref{prop:dc}, that the respective hom-double categories $\cM on_{vw} \fB(A,B)$, $\cB r \cM on_{vw}\fB$, $\cS yl \cM on_{vw}\fB$, and $\cS ym \cM on_{vw}\fB$ exist.

We need to check that the unit $\transid_A$ is a well-defined pseudo double functor from the trivial double category to the respective hom-double-categories, as well as braided, sylleptic and symmetric cells. 
The unit 1-cells $\transid_A$ are monoidal for all objects $A \in$ \fB,  with the monoidal structure $\xi, \iota$ given by the unitor 2-cells, and $\gamma, \delta$, and $\omega$ by coherence cells for the structure of the double category. The constraints boil down to simple manipulations of coherence cells, which hold by coherence of double categories. By functoriality of $\transid$, its image on the loose 2-cell  is isomorphic to the loose identity $\looseid_{\transid_A}$. This isomorphism gives rise to the following lax monoidal structure on $\transid_{\transid_A}$:

Coherence equations~\ref{eq:mon2cell1}, \ref{eq:mon2cell2}, \ref{eq:mon2cell3}, and~\cite[(BTA1) p143]{mccrudden:bal-coalgb} hold by simple manipulations of the isomorphisms. This makes $\transid_{\transid_A}$ a braided, sylleptic, or symmetric monoidal 2-cell if $\transid_A$ is braided, sylleptic, or symmetric, respectively, and the colax and pseudo cases are automatic.
%An analogous construction makes $\transid_{\transid_A}$ into an colax monoidal 2-cell. 

By functoriality, the image of $\transid$ on the  tight 2-cell and 3-cell equal $\tightid_{\transid_A}$ and $\looseid_{\tightid_{\transid_A}} = \tightid_{\looseid_{\transid_A}}$, respectively. These cells are braided, symmetric or sylleptic; lax, colax, or strong monoidal, depending on $A$. It follows that $\transid_A$ is a well-defined functor from the trivial double category to the respective hom-double-categories.

Next, we need to show that monoidal structure is preserved by the composition along a 0-cell boundary.
For any two lax monoidal 1-cells $f:A \rightarrow B$, $g:B \rightarrow C$, the composite $g \comp f$ is monoidal with $\chi^{g \comp f}$ and $\iota^{g \comp f}$ defined below. 
\begin{align}
\chi_{g \comp f} &: \hspace{.5cm} &\otimes (gf \times gf) \xlooseRightarrow{\chi_g \looseid_{f \times f}} g \otimes (f \times f) \xlooseRightarrow{\looseid_g \chi_f} gf \tens \\
\iota_{g \comp f} & : \hspace{.5cm} &I_C \xlooseRightarrow{\iota_g} g I_B \xlooseRightarrow{\looseid_g \iota_f} gfI_A
\end{align}

The structure 3-cell $\gamma^{g\circ f}$ for is given below. For readability, we write "$\hspace{5pt}\widehat{}\hspace{5pt}$" to express that we have left out some coherence 3-cells, which are needed to make the source and target of the 3-cell well defined.

The 3-cells $\delta^{g \comp f}$ and $\omega^{g \comp f}$ are defined similarly, and so is $u^{g \comp f}$ when $g, f$ are braided monoidal 1-cells. 

Let $f,h: A \rightarrow B $ and $g,i: B \rightarrow C$ be lax monoidal 1-cells and let $\alpha: f \rightarrow h$, $\beta: g \rightarrow i$ be lax monoidal 2-cells, the composite $\beta \comp \alpha$ is lax monoidal with the following structure 3-cells

Colax and strong monoidal structure 2-cells are obtained dually.

Let $f,h: A \rightarrow B $ and $g,i: B \rightarrow C$ be lax monoidal 1-cells and let $\alpha: f \rightarrow h$, $\beta: g \rightarrow i$ be monoidal icons, the composite $\beta \comp \alpha$ is monoidal with $N^{\beta \comp \alpha}:= N^{\beta} \horc \looseid_{\beta} N^{\alpha}$ and $\Sigma^{\beta \comp \alpha}:= \Sigma^{\beta}\looseid_{\alpha \times \alpha} \horc \looseid_{\beta} \Sigma^{\alpha}$.

When $g,f$ are strong monoidal, the maps $\chi_{g \comp f}$ and $\overline{\chi_{g \comp f}}$ are an adjoint equivalence, constructed by the enriched composition from the adjoint equivalence of the pairs $\chi_g, \overline{\chi_g}$ and $\chi_f, \overline{\chi_f}$. Similarly, $\iota_{g \comp f}$ and $\overline{\iota_{g \comp f}}$ form an adjoint equivalence. One can check that the required pairs of 3-cells correspond to eachother as mates by componentwise application of the adjoint equivalences for the composites of $\iota_{g \comp f}$ and $\chi_{g \comp f}$.

In all coherence equations between 3-cells for the monoidal and braided, sylleptic and symmetric structure of composition above, each 3-cell consists of a component for the first composite  composed with the identity on the second composite, and a component for the second composite composed with the identity on the product of the first composite with itself. This means that the coherence equations for $g \comp f$  can be established by componentwise application of the equations for $g$ and $f$. Some 3-cells also contain coherence cells, but these equally break up in a part concerning the first, and a part concerning the second component. Manipulation of these coherence cells results in the required equalities. Note that rewriting the 1-cells and composites of loose 2-cells is necessary in several of the steps. A similar argument holds for coherence equations for braided, sylleptic and symmetric cells.

Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be two composable monoidal 3-cells. It is easy to see that the composition $\Gamma \comp \Delta$ satisfies the two equations for monoidal 3-cells. This is a matter of applying the equations for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ sequentially.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
  Note that even though $\fB$ is 1-strict, $\cMon_{ll}\fB$ is not.
  In particular, our construction cannot be ``iterated'' without generalizing our definitions.
  However, if such a generalization were made, it would be natural to conjecture that $\cMon_{pp}\cMon_{pp}\fB \simeq \cBr\cMon_{pp}\fB$, analogously to~\cite[Remark 5.1]{js:braided}, and similarly $\cMon_{pp}\cMon_{pp}\cMon_{pp}\fB \simeq \cSyl\cMon_{pp}\fB$ and $\cMon_{pp}\cMon_{pp}\cMon_{pp}\cMon_{pp}\fB \simeq \cSym\cMon_{pp}\fB$.
  Similarly, a monoidal object in $\cMon_{ll}\fBicat$ ought to yield a notion of ``duoidal bicategory'' categorifying~\cite{am:mfsha,bm:duoidal}, and so on.
\end{rmk}

 \begin{lem}\label{lem:funcmonob}
   Let $F: T \rightarrow S$ be a 1-strict functor of 1-strict locally cubical bicategories with products.
   If $F$ preserves products, it preserves  monoidal objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells as well as any braided, sylleptic or symmetric structure on the objects, 1-cells, 2-cells, icons and 3-cells.
 \end{lem}
 
 \begin{proof}
Let $A$ be a monoidal object. As the functor $F$ preserves products, we have a product $F(A) \times_{F} F(A) = F(A \times A)$. As a consequence $\ten\maps
  A\times A\to A$ induces 1-cells $\ten_{F} \maps
 FA\times_{F} F A\to FA$ and $I_{F}:= F(I_A)$. 
 
Since $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ are globular, we have an equality $F(f \comp g) = F(f) \comp F(g)$ for all $f$ and $g$ and for the identity 1-cell we have an equality $F(\transid_A) = \transid_{F(A)}$. The loose associativity 2-cell of $A$ gives rise to a loose 2-cell
  \[\vcenter{\xymatrix@C=6pc{F(A)\times F(A)\times F(A) \rtwocell^{\ten_{F}
        (\Id\times\ten_{F})}_{\ten_{F}(\ten_{F}\times\Id)}{\hspace{.2cm}\fa_{F}\eqv} &F(A) }}\]
  which simply equals $F(\alpha)$ together with the invertible 2-cells.
  
  Likewise, the unit constraints $l, r$ as well as the constraints for (braided) monoidal 1-cells $\sigma$ induce 1-cells $l_{F}, r_{F}$, and $\sigma_{F}$, respectively. Note that the swap functor $\tau$ is mapped by $F$ to the swap functor for the product $\times_{F}$, so $\sigma_{F}$ is well-defined.
  
 Furthermore, the invertible 3-cell filling the Mac Lane pentagon lifts to the invertible 3-cell of the Mac Lane Pentagon for $F(A)$. Which is simply its image under $F$, composed the natural transformations $F_{\odot}$, $\phi$,and $\phi_u$ ensuring that it has the right type.

 Note that there may be several way to paste these 3-cells, but by coherence of enriched pseudo functors, the result is the same. Likewise, the invertible 3-cells $\mu, \lambda,\rho$, as well as $R,S$, and $v$ witnessing the braiding and syllepsis, lift to the appropriate 3-cells for $F(A)$.
   Finally,  the three equations between pasting composites of $\pi_{F}, \mu_{F}, \lambda_{F}, \rho_{F}$ hold by coherence of enriched pseudo functors.

%Similarly, we prove that $\cT$ preserves braided, sylleptic and symmetric structure. The swap functor $\tau$ is mapped by $\cT$ to the swap functor for the product $\times_{\cT}$. It follows that the braiding 2-cell $\sigma: \tens \looseRightarrow \tens \tau$  gives rise to a braiding 

%\[\vcenter{\xymatrix@C=6pc{\cT(A)\times\cT(A) \rtwocell^{\ten_{\cT}
  %      }_{\ten_{\cT}\tau}{\hspace{.2cm}\sigma_{\cT}\eqv} &\cT(A) }}\]
        
%Analogously to $\alpha$, the invertible globular 3-cells $S, T$, and $\upsilon$ are lifted to their images under $\cT$, augmented with instances of $\phi$ to ensure that the 3-cells have the right type. 

Similarly, one can show that for a monoidal transformation $f$, $F(f)$ is monoidal with structure loose 2-cells $F(\iota_f)$ and $F(\chi_f)$ and 3-cells obtained from $F(\omega),  F(\gamma)$, and $F(\delta)$ analogously to $\alpha$. If $f$ is braided, the braiding of $F(f)$ is witnessed by the 3-cell obtained from $F(u)$. Likewise, $F$ preserves any monoidal, braided, sylleptic and symmetric structure of tight 2-morphisms, loose 2-cells and 3-cells. 
 \end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:lcbcfunctor}
  Let $F: \fB  \rightarrow \fC$ be a 1-strict functor between 1-strict locally cubical bicategories with products.
  If $F$ preserves products, then it lifts to the functors below between locally cubical bicategories, for $v,w \in \{l,c,p\}$.
\begin{align*}
\cM on_{vw}F &: \cM on_{vw} \fB  \rightarrow \cM on_{vw}\fC\\ 
\cBr \cM on_{vw} F &: \cBr \cM on_{vw} \fB  \rightarrow \cBr \cM on_{vw}\fC\\
 \cSyl \cM on_{vw}F &: \cSyl \cM on_{vw} \fB  \rightarrow \cSyl \cM on_{vw}\fC\\
\cSym \cM on_{vw}F &: \cSym \cM on_{vw} \fB  \rightarrow \cSym \cM on_{vw}\fC
\end{align*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:funcmonob}, the assignment of $F$ on objects and higher cells is well-defined in the respective categories.
We wil show that functor $F$ gives rise to a pseudo double functor $\cM on_lF: \cM on_l \fB(A, B)  \rightarrow \cM on_l\fC(\cM on_lF(A), \cM on_lF(B))$. The other functors are derived in a similar way. We need to verify that $F(N^{\alpha \verc \beta}) = F(N^{\alpha}) \verc F(N^{\beta})$ and $F(N^{\tightid_f}) = N^{\tightid_{Ff}}$ in $\cM on_l\fC$ and likewise for $\Sigma$. This follows from functoriality of $F$, the fact that $N^{\alpha \verc \beta} = N^{\alpha \verc \beta}$ and $N^{\tightid_f} = \tightid_{\iota_f}$, $F(\iota_f) = \iota_{Ff}$.
The natural transformations $F_{\odot}$ and $F_U$ are well-defined 3-cells in $\cM onD$; the respective equations hold by coherence of the pseudo double functor $F$.
Finally, we need to prove that $\phi$ and $\phi_u$ are well-defined tight transformations in $\cM on \fC(F A, F B)$. Since their components are globular 3-cells, we only need to check that these are monoidal. The equations hold by coherence of enriched functors after expanding the definitions of $M^{F\alpha \comp F \beta}, M^{F(\alpha \comp \beta)}, M^{F(\looseid_f)}$, and $M^{\looseid_{F f}}$ and similarly for $\Pi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{thm:H}
  The functor $\cH: \fDblf \rightarrow \fBicat$ lifts to the functors
  \begin{align*}
\cM on_{vw}\cH &: \cM on_{vw} \fDblf  \rightarrow \cM on_{vw}\fBicat\\ 
\cBr \cM on_{vw} \cH &: \cBr \cM on_{vw} \fDblf  \rightarrow \cBr \cM on_{vw}\fBicat\\
 \cSyl \cM on_{vw}\cH &: \cSyl \cM on_{vw} \fDblf  \rightarrow \cSyl \cM on_{vw}\fBicat\\
\cSym \cM on_{vw}\cH &: \cSym \cM on_{vw} \fDblf  \rightarrow \cSym \cM on_{vw}\fBicat.
\end{align*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\cH$ is 1-strict, the result then follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:lcbcfunctor}.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}\label{rmk:loosely-strong}
  Recall that the notation $\fDblf$ means that we restrict the 2-cells to have \emph{loosely strong} companions.
  As noted in \autoref{thm:iso-strong}, the ``loosely strong'' restriction is automatic for \emph{invertible} 2-cells, so it does not appear at the level of monoidal objects: any monoidal double category with companions has a monoidal loose bicategory.
  However, in order for a lax monoidal double functor $F:\lD\to\lE$ to induce a monoidal functor of loose bicategories, it does not suffice for $\lD$ and $\lE$ to have companions: the constraints $FA \tens FB \to F(A\tens B)$ and $I_\lE \to F(I_\lD)$ must induce pseudonatural, rather than colax natural, transformations.
  But, again, for a \emph{strong} monoidal double functor, this extra condition is automatic.
