\section{Intercategories of monoidal objects}
\label{sec:intercat}

In the previous section we constructed, from a product-preserving functor of locally cubical bicategories, \emph{twelve} new functors between locally cubical bicategories of monoidal objects according to whether the objects are braided, sylleptic, symmetric, or none, and whether the morphisms are lax, colax, or strong.
We now show that this menagerie can be reduced to only \emph{four} functors (according to the choice of objects), by incorporating lax, colax, and strong monoidal morphisms into a single structure.

One dimension down, the relevant structure is a \emph{strict} double category, with lax and colax morphisms as its horizontal and vertical arrows; see e.g.~\cite{gp:double-adjoints,shulman:dblderived}.
In our categorified case, we will use the \emph{intercategories} of~\cite{gp:intercategories-i,gp:intercategories-ii}.
