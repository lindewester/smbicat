\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Symmetric monoidal bicategories are important in many contexts.
However, the definition of even a monoidal bicategory
(see~\cite{gps:tricats,nick:tricats}), let alone a symmetric monoidal
one
(see~\cite{kv:2cat-zam,kv:bm2cat,bn:hda-i,ds:monbi-hopfagbd,crans:centers,mccrudden:bal-coalgb,gurski:brmonbicat}) 
or a monoidal functor between such~\cite{nick:tricatsbook,mccrudden:bal-coalgb}

is quite imposing, and time-consuming to verify in any example.

In this paper we describe a method for constructing (symmetric) monoidal
bicategories which is hardly more difficult than constructing a pair
of ordinary (symmetric) monoidal categories.
While not universally applicable, this method applies in many cases of interest.
The underlying idea has often been implicitly used in particular cases, such as
bicategories of enriched profunctors, but to our knowledge the first
general statement was claimed in~\cite[Appendix B]{shulman:frbi}.
In the unpublished~\cite{shulman:smbicat}, the first author worked out the details for the construction of monoidal bicategories themselves.
Here we include that work and build on it further to construct monoidal functors, transformations, and so on between monoidal bicategories as well, making the entire construction into a functor.
\footnote{These details have also been worked out
in~\cite[\S5]{gg:ldstr-tricat} from a different perspective, using
``locally-double bicategories''.  Our goal is to be more
comprehensive, considering also the case of symmetric monoidal
structure and the construction of monoidal functors and
transformations.}

The method relies on the fact that in many bicategories, the 1-cells
are not the most fundamental notion of `morphism' between the objects.
For instance, in the bicategory \cMod\ of rings, bimodules, and
bimodule maps, the more fundamental notion of morphism between objects
is a ring homomorphism. The addition of these extra morphisms promotes
a bicategory to a \emph{double category}, or a category internal to
\cCat.  The extra morphisms are usually stricter than the 1-cells in
the bicategory and easier to deal with for coherence questions; in
many cases it is quite easy to show that we have a \emph{symmetric
  monoidal double category}.  The central observation is that in most
cases (when the natural transformations have `loosely strong companions and conjoints' for the tight morphisms) we can then `lift' this
symmetric monoidal structure to the original bicategory.  That is, we
prove the following theorem:

\begin{thm}\label{thm:mondbl-monbi-intro}
  If \lD\ is a monoidal double category, of which the monoidal constraints have loosely strong companions and conjoints, then its underlying bicategory $\cH(\lD)$ is a monoidal bicategory.  If \lD\ is braided
  or symmetric, so is $\cH(\lD)$. Furthermore, the assignment $\cH$
  extends to a trifunctor, so we can use it to construct functors and
  transformations between monoidal bicategories as well.
\end{thm}

We expect similar theorems to be true in higher dimensions.  For
instance, Chris Douglas~\cite{douglas:tfttalk} has suggested that many
apparent tricategories are more naturally bicategories internal to
\cCat\ or categories internal to \cTwocat; and in most such cases
arising in practice, we can again `lift' the coherence to give a
tricategory after discarding the additional structure.

We propose the generic term \textbf{$(n\times k)$-category}
(pronounced ``$n$-by-$k$-category'') for an $n$-category internal to
$k$-categories, a structure which has $(n+1)(k+1)$ different types of
cells or morphisms arranged in an $(n+1)$ by $(k+1)$ grid.  Thus
double categories may be called \textbf{1x1-categories}, while in
place of tricategories we may consider 2x1-categories and
1x2-categories --- or even 1x1x1-categories, i.e.\ triple categories,
as in~\cite{gp:intercategories-i,gp:intercategories-ii}.  Any
$(n\times k)$-category which satisfies a suitable lifting property
should have an underlying $(n+k)$-category, but clearly as $n$ and $k$
grow an increasing amount of structure is discarded in this process.

% , such as duality and
% trace~\cite{ps:traces} or autonomous
% structure~\cite{ds:monbi-hopfagbd,street:funct-calc,dms:antipodes},

There is a good case to be made that often the extra morphisms should
\emph{not} be discarded; indeed this is the perspective of much work
on double categories.  However, even from this perspective, sometimes
it really is the underlying $(n+k)$-category that one cares about; for
instance, the Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis asserts a universal
property of the $(n+1)$-category of cobordisms which is not shared by
the $(n\times 1)$-category from which it is naturally constructed
(see~\cite{lurie:tft}).  Thus, regardless of one's philosophical bent,
results such as \autoref{thm:mondbl-monbi-intro} are of interest.

Proceeding to the contents of this paper, in
\S\ref{sec:symm-mono-double} we review the definition of symmetric
monoidal double categories, and in \S\ref{sec:comp-conj} we recall the
notions of `companion' and `conjoint' whose presence supplies the
necessary lifting property, which we call being \emph{fibrant}.  
(Fibrant double categories have also been called ``framed bicategories''~\cite{shulman:frbi}, and are roughly equivalent to ``proarrow equipments''~\cite{wood:proarrows-i}).

Then in \S\ref{sec:1x1-to-bicat} we describe a functor from double
categories with loosely strong companions and conjoints to bicategories.  This functor evidently preserves products, which intuitively means that it should preserve ``monoidal objects''; but since monoidal bicategories are such weak objects, to deduce our main theorem we need to enhance this functor to act on some higher-categorical structure that contains higher data such as pseudonatural transformations and modifications.
The obvious choice is a tricategory~\cite{gps:tricats}, but we can make do with a simpler structure, namely a \emph{locally cubical bicategory}~\cite{gg:ldstr-tricat}, i.e.\ a bicategory enriched over double categories.
In \S\ref{sec:mono-objects} we show that any product-preserving functor between locally cubical bicategories preserves monoidal objects of all sorts, and indeed induces another functor of locally cubical bicategories.
There is a lot to check here, but the hardest part is writing down all the definitions in the appropriate generality!
Then in \S\ref{sec:constr-symm-mono} we specialize this to the functor from double categories with loosely strong companions and conjoints for all transformations to bicategories, yielding functorial constructions of monoidal, braided, and symmetric monoidal bicategories.
Finally, in \S\ref{sec:Alg} we illustrate our method by constructing the symmetric monoidal bicategory ${\cA}lg(\bC)$ of algebras, bimodules and bimodule homomorphisms, as well as that of dagger algebras, dagger bimodules, and dagger bimodule homomorphisms, in a monoidal category \bC, varying functorially in \bC.
